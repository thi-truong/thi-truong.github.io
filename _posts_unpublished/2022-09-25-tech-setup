* I go to the [Supplementary Table 1 on the science direct page](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000925411200366X#ec0005). I downloaded the spreadsheet which is an xls file. I save it with the default name, "1-s2.0-S000925411200366X-mmc1.xls". It goes into "My Downloads" folder on Windows, since it's easier for me to rename and move later rather than get this sorted upon download (maybe I dislike working in tiny dialog boxes...)
* * I inspect [the data sheet](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92915699/192112241-4b9f13e0-2007-405e-ba4f-5a9fbe7fe2c4.png) to see what I am working with.
* I want to produce a sheet where every row/column is a value, so I look for remove columns that are not needed. I end up deleting C and D because they are not numerical and will not be useful when plotting (not to worry, the data still lives in the other tab, "Data (original)".
* I assigned [unique number values into leftmost column](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92915699/192112331-6b066799-d89c-4462-82ef-df72f467a575.png). There is probably a better way to do this, but I have them as 1 to 4939. I also freeze paned first column and row for ease of looking at the data.
