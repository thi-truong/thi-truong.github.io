A week ago, I was at an outdoor end-of-year celebration for my department. I ran into a faculty member who I hadn't spoken to in person since before the pandemic (aside from a few hallway collisions). The topic of AGU came up, and he asked me how I liked it when I went in 2019. My sentiments about the conference were forged while I was in San Francicso. But now, 2 years later, I was responding for the first time with the whole truth when someone asked how my previous AGU experience was.

I said without hesitation, "I hated it".

Hate is a strong word. Of course I didn't hate it, but my AGU experience did not pay dividends to me. This blog isn't about weighing the pro's and con's of paying pre-pandemic prices for a virtual or hybrid conference. This blog post is not about the invisible cost of time spent chasing reimbursement money. This is about satisfaction and the Big Conference experience, and all the planning, traveling, preparation, networking, socializing it demands.

I can't say I enjoyed my first ASU all that much, except for fitting in this rite of passage. Ooh, there's the Moscone Center. Ooh, there's more posters than I have ever seen in my life. Ooh, there's swag in the exhibition hall. That is the picture-esque AGU experience.

Instead, I was concerned about money (because I always am), saving money on lodging meant staying a little bit too far and feeling very trapped by the options. All of my friends who were going to poster sessions were presenting at the same time. I had friends who were going, but not anyone who I really felt like I could truly decompress with.

The poster effort was not worth it. I think I could have designed a Better Poster and gotten the same response. I also decided to go with a cloth poster-- my anxious traveling self enjoyed the lack of a poster tube to haul, but a poster would have actually been easier to read when hung up.

I was involved in Unpacking Diversity but I didn't feel too comfortable talking with people at posters. I saw a great poster about tactile landforms for blind students, but the presenter was quite popular and busy, so I did not bother to jump in to ask basic questions.

So yeah, maybe a poster session on a Friday is always an invitation for a bad time, but I expected a few more opportunities to connect with people.

I also realized that talks were quite perfunctory, and that AGU was a talk mill. Talks for CVs. Talks for days. Posters for CVs. Posters for days. I also learned that post-docs were really job searching. Like, for their second post-doc. I was in my 3rd year, so I was not in the right mind to think about this, but it struck me that I would be competing not only with accomplished PhDs, but with post-docs when applying for a post-doc...

AAPI in Geoscience didn't exist back then, so I was on my own to attempt to socialize with fellow Asians. I even saw people from Vietnam, but I felt like I had no way of talking to them without stopping them in the middle of the hallway. I saved a few people with Vietnamese names in my schedule, but never made it to their posters.

Here are things I did well that took quite a bit of courage or initiative: I did the Mentoring 365 program, I asked a question during a diversity talk (one that was quite risky), I introduced myself to like, 4 or 5 people I have never met (but whose work I know of) and invited them to come to my poster. I went to the conference every single day. I went to my department's social hour even though I would have preferred to do nothing at night.

I met a few great people at AGU, and ran into a few people I knew back at Scripps! I made a lot of great figures that I have re-used several times since then. 2 years later, I was actually able to have a conversation with a grad student in the office hallway about the poster.

I guess I knew it that same day, I resolved to never have the same conference experience again. I would not favor my advisor's suggestions over my own preference or intuition about how to display the science. I would familiarize myself with the schedule before the conference, so that I wouldn't feel overwhelmed during that stressful week. I would find more opportunities to have casual, low stakes conversations with people. I would get pictures of my presentation. And I would talk to someone who is Vietnamese.

So, when is AGU worth it?
-----
For me, AGU is worth it when I grow my network and forge connections with people, in a way that wasn't possible outside the conference. Others are exposed to my research, I am exposed to theirs. We may have conversations that feel topical and timely, perhaps even productive! Yet, there is no pressure to follow up immediately. Taking a step back and reflecting on my how I have grown in my certainty and confidence since AGU in 2019, I also see that AGU helps me transcend the isolation of my everyday workplace: my department, and my own brain. It is commonly understood that graduate school can feel isolating, and working in a small field even so. I aim to transcend beyond my department, the usual people I see, and gain perspective that helps me see the end goal.

_It's about the job, isn't it?_

Yes, AGU would feel worthwhile if I directly secured a position after networking with someone for like, an hour. Definitely. I don't really see how it is possible to be a graduate student and not see AGU for the job network potential that it is. I am glad to see people openly announce their planned entrance to the job market. I am glad to see that people would like to use the conference event as a way to get their needs met. As for myself, I am afraid that I will objectify people in terms of their value to my CV, my network, my future pursuits. I am afraid that I will not be grateful for the opportunity to meet so many people, just because a job lead could not materialize from someone's institutional power. I am afraid that if I leave AGU without more certainty for my own future, that I will have gained nothing.

That's what keeps many of us going back, isn't it? AGU is a corporation that profits off my hope, my willingness to attend a conference like this, despite the real opportunity costs. It profits off my reliance on being affiliated with an institution, a company, a non-profit, so that people will feel comfortable when they see my name and badge information. And so, AGU is worth it to me, when I can see past the institutional prestige, the corporatization of academia, the competitive race to get A Job, and elevate humanism as much as possible.

This year, AGU was worth it if I could make these happen:
- Give a talk during my session during the allotted time, without running over (and without saying, "can you hear me?")
- Use every virtual networking resource at least once (remembering fondly about how I met my good friend Luan over Goldschmidt Discord in 2020)
- Attend at least one AAPIiG member's oral session live
- Have at least one-on-one conversation with a stranger where I didn't feel totally on edge, regretful, or doubtful about how useful my presence is. Aka, have one relaxed conversation.

So, yeah, aside from the first point, my goals really related to connecting with strangers and trying to find my way through this impersonal field. Perhaps I am trying to prove to myself that this community really is or isn't for me. If I have several data points that indicate I fail at socializing with 100 folks at AGU, then the problem is really me, right?

In the end, AGU is an opportunity to collect all the data points about a community that I struggle to know through electronic mediums, pre-proofed manuscripts, academic podcasts, the list goes on. I am really just looking for data.
