A week ago, I was at an outdoor end-of-year celebration for my department. I ran into a faculty member who I hadn't spoken to in person since before the pandemic (aside from a few hallway collisions). The topic of AGU came up, and he asked me how I liked it when I went in 2019. My sentiments about the conference were forged while I was in San Francicso. But now, 2 years later, I was responding for the first time with the whole truth when someone asked how my previous AGU experience was.

I said without hesitation, "I hated it".

Hate is a strong word. Of course I didn't hate it, but my AGU experience did not pay dividends to me. This blog isn't about weighing the pro's and con's of paying pre-pandemic prices for a virtual or hybrid conference. This blog post is not about the invisible cost of time spent chasing reimbursement money. This is about satisfaction and the Big Conference experience, and all the planning, traveling, preparation, networking, socializing it demands.

I can't say I enjoyed my first AGU all that much, except for fitting in this rite of passage. Ooh, there's the Moscone Center. Ooh, there's more posters than I have ever seen in my life. Ooh, there's swag in the exhibition hall. That is the picture-esque AGU experience.

**Things that didn't go well:**
* I was concerned about money (because I always am), saving money on lodging meant staying a little bit too far and feeling very trapped by the options.
* I did not enjoy the experience of giving a poster presentation.
  * Yeah, maybe a poster session on a Friday is always an invitation for a bad time, but I expected a few more opportunities to connect with people. It was way too crowded and people seemed overall more interested in other posters.
  * The poster effort was not worth it. I think I could have designed a Better Poster and gotten the same response. I also decided to go with a cloth poster-- my anxious traveling self enjoyed the lack of a poster tube to haul, but a poster would have actually been easier to read when hung up.
  * All of my friends who were going to poster sessions were presenting at the same time. I could not even get anyone to bring me a coffee at the time
  * I didn't get any pictures of myself at my poster. A few days before the poster session, I actually asked a conference attendee to come, but considering we were total strangers before we arranged this, it's understandable that this fell through too
  * I even had a co-author come by who did not seem interested in sticking around
* I was involved in Unpacking Diversity but I didn't feel too comfortable talking with people at posters. I saw a great poster about tactile landforms for blind students, but the presenter was quite popular and busy, so I did not bother to jump in to ask basic questions.
* I was supposed to meet a research collaborator in person for the first time. But the timing somehow didn't work out, and I wasn't able to meet them
* Crummy realizations
   * I realized that talks were quite perfunctory, and that AGU was a talk mill. Talks for CVs. Talks for days. Posters for CVs. Posters for days.
   * I learned that post-docs were _really_ job searching. Like, for their second post-doc. It dawned on me that I would be competing not only with accomplished PhDs, but with post-docs when applying for a post-doc...
* AAPI in Geoscience didn't exist back then, so I was on my own to attempt to socialize with fellow Asians. I even saw people from Vietnam, but I felt like I had no way of talking to them without stopping them in the middle of the hallway. I saved a few people with Vietnamese names in my schedule, but never made it to their posters.

**Things that went well, or actions that were worth doing**
* I did the Mentoring 365 program
* I attended a diversity session that was really illuminating. I learned about Michele Cooke's work for the first time, and disability in the geosciences. I asked a fairly risky question during this session about how to start conversations about progress in diversity and international student enrollment. It did not go well with the panel!
* I introduced myself to like, 4 or 6 people that I have never met (but whose work I know of), gave them a mean handshake, and invited them to come to my poster. (None of them came to my poster)
* I went to the conference every single day
* I went to my department's social hour even though I would have preferred to do nothing at night.
* I met a few great people at AGU, and ran into a few people I knew back at Scripps!
* I made a lot of great figures that I have re-used several times since then.
* (not during AGU, but related): 2 years later, I was actually able to have a conversation with a grad student in the office hallway about the poster.

Despite the good things that happened, I resolved to never have the same conference experience again. From that point on, I would not favor my advisor's suggestions over my own preference or intuition about how to display the science. I would familiarize myself with the schedule before the conference, so that I wouldn't feel overwhelmed during that stressful week. I would find more opportunities to have casual, low stakes conversations with people. I would get pictures of my presentation. I would plan out my networking goals ahead of time. And I would finally talk to someone who is Vietnamese.

My first thoughts, which I now believe are tempered by wanting to appear logical and sensible, is that AGU is worth it when I grow my network and forge connections with people in a way that wasn't possible outside the conference. Others are exposed to my research, I am exposed to theirs. We may have conversations that feel topical and timely, perhaps even productive! 


_It's about the job, isn't it?_

Yes, AGU would feel worthwhile if I directly secured a position after networking with someone for like, an hour. Definitely. I don't really see how it is possible to be a graduate student and not see AGU for the job network potential that it is. I am glad to see people openly announce their planned entrance to the job market. I am glad to see that people would like to use the conference event as a way to get their needs met. As for myself, I am afraid that I will objectify people in terms of their value to my CV, my network, my future pursuits. I am afraid that I will not be grateful for the opportunity to meet so many people, just because a job lead could not materialize from someone's institutional power. I am afraid that if I leave AGU without more certainty for my own future, that I will have gained nothing.

That's what keeps many of us going back, isn't it? AGU is a corporation that profits off my hope, my willingness to attend a conference like this, despite the real opportunity costs. It profits off my reliance on being affiliated with an institution, a company, a non-profit, so that people will feel comfortable when they see my name and badge information.

Still, the answer is no. AGU would not be worth it even if I "networked", because that in itself implies some kind of future reward-- a linkedin invite, a recommendation for a job, key tips for applying to a certain company, etc. It would just be worth if it I can just _connect_ with someone. So, my goals this year are different.

**This year, AGU will be worth it if I...**
- Give a talk during my session during the allotted time, without running over (and without saying, "can you hear me?")
- Use every virtual networking resource at least once (remembering fondly about how I met my good friend Luan over Goldschmidt Discord in 2020)
- Attend at least one AAPIiG member's oral session live
- Have at least one-on-one conversation with a stranger where I didn't feel totally on edge, regretful, or doubtful about how useful my presence is. Aka, have one relaxed conversation.

So, yeah, aside from the first point, my goals really related to connecting with strangers and trying to find my way through this impersonal field. Perhaps I am trying to prove to myself that this community really is or isn't for me. If I have several data points that indicate I fail at socializing with 100 folks at AGU, then the problem is really me, right?

When I take a step back and reflect on my how I have grown in my certainty and confidence since AGU in 2019, I also see that AGU helps me transcend the isolation of my everyday workplace: my department, and my own brain. It is commonly understood that graduate school can feel isolating, and working in a small field even so. I aim to transcend beyond my department, the usual people I see, and gain perspective that helps me see the end goal. It helped me shatter the illusion that AGU is a fantastic place for networking and job searching. It helped me realize that everyone is tired and overwhelmed in the scientific machine of publishing/conferencing/granting/drinking. 

In the end, AGU is an opportunity to collect all the data points about a community that I struggle to know through electronic mediums, pre-proofed manuscripts, academic podcasts, the list goes on. I am really just looking for data.
