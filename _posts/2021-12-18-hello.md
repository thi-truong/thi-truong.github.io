Hi, my name is Thi. I am pursuing a doctorate in Geology. I seek to understand processes occurring in Earth's interior, in the present-day, and ideally, the past.

I have found that academic blogs in geology tend to fall into one of these categories:
* Evidently was only created to fulfill the goal of personalizing all pages of a pre-designed website template. Usually has 2 posts from 2018. 
* Relays findings from short-term scientific research activities, expeditions, etc. Is updated by a team of researchers, or the self-proclaimed writer of the group. Sometimes this satisfies broader impact statements, or counts as outreach to the public. 
* Is owned by a corporation, but has a lot of different authors and the range of posts is surprisingly useful ([AGU blogosphere](https://blogs.agu.org/), believe it or not)
* Thoughtfully updated on a regular basis over several years. The author seems to enjoy the act of writing, introspection, and reflection. Writes about a variety of topics, not just their current topic of study. They tend to be written by senior scientists who have a lot of personal anecdotes and warm testimonials to share. 

Which one is this going to be? I am just as curious as you are!
