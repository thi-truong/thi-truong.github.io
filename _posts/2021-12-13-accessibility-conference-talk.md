When I accepted the invitation to speak at AGU, I knew I would have to pre-record a video. The only goal I ever set for myself was to have it to be as accessible as possible. I was familiar with the work required to ensure accessibility during a virtual presentation because our Unpacking group had incorporated automated captions during all of our seminars since 2020 (long before OSU paid for Otter access on all of our accounts), and I had coordinated the accommodations for Aradhna Tripati's keynote seminar back in May. This included arranging live CART, live ASL interpretation, and ordering embedded captions through Rev for an announcement video. Before I had to give up on adapting to Google Slides, my first lectures given to my geology lab class had automated captions on screen.

Any time I set up a seminar on Zoom, I always pressed "enable live transcript". Why doesn't everyone else?

I am not asking why people don't press random buttons as they prepare to give a talk on Zoom. That would be careless. I am asking why people lack the willingness to utilize as many resources as possible to maximize accessibility.

Given that we are two years into the pandemic, and it became a meme on Twitter to make fun of people who ask, "can you hear me?", "can you see my screen?", I think the tendency for people to panic while presenting on Zoom indicates a few things:

1. Zoom is not intuitive for people, whether it be because they are not used to being Webinar panelists, or are unaccustomed to features like sharing screen/muting/unmuting/etc.
2. People seek reassurance during a higher stakes setting of a timed AGU talk in front of a live audience. It would be unwise to waste 10 seconds because you did not know you were muted, instead of taking 2 seconds to confirm. In addition, AGU has had a ton of technical difficulties this week, including uneven broadcasting capabilities between in-person and virtual attendees.
3. People do not trust the their view is not the same as what others see. That is, they may actually see the "mute" button is not enabled, but they still think there is a chance the sound won't come through. Even though they see the "share screen" strip on the top of their screen, they are not sure if the right thing is being broadcasted.

Given all that, should it be a surprise that people are unwilling to explore Zoom's live transcript capabilities when they are not forced to? The anxiety of dealing with unpredictable software is understandable, and the challenge of adding an additional task of enabling captions can be daunting.

Here's my attempt to guide you towards taking that step:

Tutorial for OS users to enable live transcripts on Zoom
======
- Update your zoom
- click on live transcript
- click "enable"
- Check all types of the transcript.
- Call a friend and ask them to get on the chat with you (invite gets you the link).

For me, testing captions requires another person out of earshot from me. Usually, that requires two Zoom accounts. Every time I had to test out captions, I had to have a way of seeing the audience's side of things. I had to ask a friend to sign on to Zoom with me, or check if things were visible on their end. What if I did this, what if I did that? I went through several iterations of caption types and ways to display them (Otter, Rev, some live caption website, OBS, Google Slides, Powerpoint). So, it takes another person and some time.

FYI: If you are the presenter and you are on video only, no one can see the subtitles just because you turned them on. If you are an audience member in the Zoom and you select subtitles, no one else can see yours. When you view subtitles or transcript, that's only for you, not for the whole Zoom call.

However, if you are a presenter and you share your screen, and that display includes your Zoom window, the audience will see the subtitles. For example, if you do some kind of mirror display.

Ensuring your Zoom attendees know how to access captions
======
- Use screenshots that direct people to the exact place on the screen
- Let people know they can close the pop-up about live transcript, and they will still be able to access the options.
