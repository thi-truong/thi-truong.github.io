Given that we are two years into the pandemic, it is interesting to see many Zoom blunders occurring at AGU this year. There have been many popular tweets making the rounds about how often people ask, "can you hear me?", "can you see my screen?". It is a popular space on Zoom bingo cards.

I think the tendency for people to panic while presenting on Zoom indicates a few things:

1. Zoom is not intuitive for people, whether it be because they are not used to being Webinar panelists, or are unaccustomed to features like sharing screen/muting/unmuting/etc.
2. People seek reassurance during a higher stakes setting of a timed AGU talk in front of a live audience. It would be unwise to waste 10 seconds because you did not know you were muted, instead of taking 2 seconds to confirm. In addition, AGU has had a ton of technical difficulties this week, including uneven broadcasting capabilities between in-person and virtual attendees.
3. People do not trust the their view is not the same as what others see. That is, they may actually see the "mute" button is not enabled, but they still think there is a chance the sound won't come through. Even though they see the "share screen" strip on the top of their screen, they are not sure if the right thing is being broadcasted.

Given all that, it should not be a surprise that people are unwilling to explore Zoom's live transcript capabilities. The anxiety of dealing with unpredictable software is understandable, and the challenge of adding an additional task of enabling captions can be daunting. But still, I ask, why don't you click "enable live transcript" when you have the option? I am looking at you, OSU users.

Here's my attempt to guide you towards taking that step:

Tutorial for OS users to enable live transcripts on Zoom
======
- Update your zoom
- click on live transcript
- click "enable"
- Check all types of the transcript.
- Call a friend and ask them to get on the chat with you (invite gets you the link).

For me, testing captions requires another person out of earshot from me. Usually, that requires two Zoom accounts. Every time I had to test out captions, I had to have a way of seeing the audience's side of things. I had to ask a friend to sign on to Zoom with me, or check if things were visible on their end. What if I did this, what if I did that? I went through several iterations of caption types and ways to display them (Otter, Rev, some live caption website, OBS, Google Slides, Powerpoint). So, it takes another person and some time.

FYI: If you are the presenter and you are on video only, no one can see the subtitles just because you turned them on. If you are an audience member in the Zoom and you select subtitles, no one else can see yours. When you view subtitles or transcript, that's only for you, not for the whole Zoom call.

However, if you are a presenter and you share your screen, and that display includes your Zoom window, the audience will see the subtitles. For example, if you do some kind of mirror display.

Establishing a standard protocol for all of your events
======
Make a damn checklist, for yourself, and for anyone else who is running the presentation. You know that [study about surgeons and checklists](https://doi.org/10.1001/archsurg.2007.21)? Make the checklist and use it. Don't let accessibility be something you easily forget because it is so often forgotten.

For example, here's the Unpacking keynote checklist. For reference, this was for a webinar with 500 person capacity:

> Rename yourself to “Host - Thi Truong (she/her)
> 
> Press “Start Webinar”
> 
> Change share screen settings → all panelists can share
> 
> Find attendee named (Captioner's Name)
> 
> Promote this person to panelist.
> 
> Right click this person's name and select “assign to type Closed Captions”.
> 
> To confirm you’ve assigned the captioner, look for a blue “CC” icon on the right-hand side of the participant list, next to the captioner’s name.
> 
> Click “closed caption, assign participant to type”, and/or select on “Closed Captions are available” in the bottom of the Zoom window to enable captions.
> 
> Set ASL interpreter view: View-->Host’s view or View-->Gallery view
> 
> Once we are in share screen mode, people are able to resize the size of the speaker video relative to the shared screen if they need to be able to see interpreters
> 
> During accessibility slide, write these two messages in the Zoom chat to everyone:
> 
> Attendees can view captions by using the closed caption feature. Click the CC button at the bottom center of your Zoom screen to show subtitles or view the transcript as it is updated. Click and drag the subtitles to change their position on the screen.
> 
> We also have ASL interpreters at today’s session. While in share screen mode, you can adjust the size of the presentation relative to the panelists.



Ensuring your Zoom attendees know how to access captions
======
- Use screenshots that direct people to the exact place on the screen
- Let people know they can close the pop-up about live transcript, and they will still be able to access the options.
