When I accepted the invitation to speak at AGU, I knew I would have to pre-record a video. To be honest, the only goal I ever set for myself was to have it to be accessible. I was familiar with the work required to ensure accessibility during a virtual presentation because our Unpacking group had incorporated automated captions during all of our seminars since 2020 (long before OSU paid for Otter access on all of our accounts), and I had coordinated the accommodations for Aradhna Tripati's keynote seminar back in May. This included arranging live CART, live ASL interpretation, and ordering embedded captions through Rev for an announcement video. Before I had to give up on adapting to Google Slides, my first lectures given to my geology lab class had automated captions on screen. Any time I set up a seminar on Zoom, I always pressed "enable live transcript". And I did not do this alone. Every time I had to test something out, I had to ask a friend to sign on to Zoom with me, or check if things were visible on their end. What if I did this, what if I did that? Do people hesitate to ask others to help them?
