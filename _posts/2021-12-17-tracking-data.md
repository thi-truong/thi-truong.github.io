Was watching a lecture on The Epistemology of Data Use and reflected on my concern with geochemical data sets. Objective of this blog is to track data histories and journeys through metadata for the highest 3He/4He values found in the world.

I always think about geochemical data sets. I think what they lack, despite their numbers, is attention to the nuances at the individual volcanoes.
