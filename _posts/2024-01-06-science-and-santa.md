I want to write more about interdisciplinary conversations, which are so impactful for this point of my career. These days, I have the most conversations with James Adams, who is a postdoctoral scholar in Anthropology, also in the CLIMATE Justice Initiative with me. Last quarter, we collaborated on some lectures about data sharing and research questions, towards the goal of curriculum development. We have also had more expansive conversations about the state of historical sciences, and he has motivated me to read more of non-Latour authors about the topic of scales and Earth. Real growth happening in this space since this [2022 blog post](https://thi-truong.github.io/posts/2022/01/16/thoughts-reading-latour)!

Recently, our conversation has turned to information and the Internet. James recommended a book by Alexander Galloway, [Protocol: How Control Exists after Decentralization](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262572330/protocol/). Here is an excerpt from the foreword about how the Internet functions as a network (p. xv):

> More than that, this infrastructure and set of procedures grows out of U.S. government and military interests in developing high-technology communications capabilities (from ARPA to DARPA to dot-coms). At an even finer level of detail, the Internet is not a simple “ask and you shall receive” tool. 

Our conversation and this quote reminded me about a secret that I have held for decades, but I am ready to come clean. Science made me believe in Santa Claus.

Let me explain!

Around Y2K (the early 2000s), I was in the later years of elementary school. Today, my elementary school gets a 2/10 on the GreatSchools rating. I had not tested successfully into the GATE program, so I was not a "gifted" student. I barely had science education, and probably did not understand what "science" meant. During one winter break period, I had caught a commercial on TV that advertised Santa tracking by an entity called NORAD. This YouTube video [NORAD Tracks Santa 2006 Trailer](youtube.com/watch?v=XcMvAeic-sY) is similar to what I saw on TV. In particular, these screenshots show what the invitation looked like to learn more:

I easily found the website that advertised the compelling promise, that one could actually track Santa around the world on Christmas Eve.

I was presented with these kinds of graphics and this kind of writing. 

<img src="/images/NORAD_Track_Santa_Here_2004.png" alt="Screenshot of NORAD Santa Tracker page from December 2004 showing map and links to learn more">

This example is from the [Wayback machine's NORAD tracker page in 2004](https://web.archive.org/web/20041230202809/http://www.noradsanta.org/english/radar/index.html) from December 2004, notably the 50th year of this general tradition. I highly recommend you click around to see what my ~10 year old self was reading.

After studying the website in detail, I was confused. *Look at all these maps! Look at how Santa flew by the Eiffel Tower!* The basic narrative that emerged, in the privacy of my own brain, during one winter break in San Diego, without access to school, teachers, scientists or anyone, was, "I thought Santa wasn't real...but now, I'm not sure." My first major exposure to the intersection of the Internet and science/technology made me question, for the first time in my life, whether or not Santa was real. Unbenknowst to me, it was my first time seeing science and technology commit to convincing the public of a falsehood. I could not comprehend that the resources required to produce these maps, pictures, and maintain personnel to answer phone calls on Christmas Eve, were not borne out of genuine needs. In my sleuthing to try to follow the science and prove that Santa really did not exist, I failed.

In hindsight, it is painfully obvious that the webcam pictures and the videos weren't actully captured by cameras of some flying entity. Plus, the Comic Sans MS and web design would have given it away. In all seriousness, one can ask, to what degree can science be complicit in deception to accomplish its aims of general outreach? One can argue that there is no science presented here-- but there is. The maps are predictions, and the "real route" is different. This is why some webcam shots are successful and some are not. So science was there. But, it is not uncommon to be let down by the idea of [following the science](https://www.philosophyetc.net/2021/01/theres-no-such-thing-as-following.html).

Instead, I want to explore the question: why would scientific organizations like NOAA be in cahoots with Santa Claus? Recently, [NASA did not delay a mission to deliver human remains to the moon](https://www.space.com/nasa-responds-navajo-nation-objection-human-remains-moon), ignoring concerns from the Navajo Nation, stating that "we do not and never have let religious beliefs dictate humanity’s space efforts". Major government scientific organizations choose to ignore religion, while committing to the myth of Santa Claus for 50+ years in their outreach activities. 

My guess is that the image of Santa Claus in the United States is a commercialized, marketed myth, reflecting a type of surveillance of year-round morality. Conveniently, the NORAD Santa Tracker makes a convincing case to worry about what Santa thinks about you. The success of NORAD in providing resources every year to convince people about Santa tracking is in line with the increased role of government in maintaining certain beliefs in greater society, which historically were in the purview of parents. In addition, it normalizes the possibility of surveillance of ocean, land and sky, for the purpose of locating Santa. It's a great testing ground for the U.S. military on the Internet, as suggested in the book excerpt above.

In the week of Christmas 2023, the NORAD Santa Tracker website continued the yearly tradition of showing a map to track Santa, but also provided a hotline for inquiries. Had I known a few weeks ago, I would have called. My 10 year old self would have been too shy to ask. Today, I am intensely curious to know how technological and scientific vocabulary emerges in response to this burning question to the NORAD hotline: "Is this real?"
