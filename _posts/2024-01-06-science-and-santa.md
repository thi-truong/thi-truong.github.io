I want to write more about interdisciplinary conversations, which are so impactful for this point of my career. These days, I have the most conversations with James Adams, who is a postdoctoral scholar in Anthropology, also in the CLIMATE Justice Initiative with me. Last quarter, we collaborated on some lectures about data sharing and research questions, towards the goal of curriculum development. We have also had more expansive conversations about the state of historical sciences, and he has motivated me to read more of non-Latour authors about the topic of scales and Earth. Real growth happening in this blog space since [2022](https://thi-truong.github.io/posts/2022/01/16/thoughts-reading-latour).

Recently, our conversation has turned to information and the Internet. He recommended a book by Alexander Galloway, [Protocol: How Control Exists after Decentralization](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262572330/protocol/). Here is an excerpt from the foreword about how the Internet functions as a network (p. xv):

> More than that, this infrastructure and set of procedures grows out of U.S. government and military interests in developing high-technology communications capabilities (from ARPA to DARPA to dot-coms). At an even finer level of detail, the Internet is not a simple “ask and you shall receive” tool. 

Our conversation and this quote reminded me about a secret that I have held for decades. I am ready to come clean: Science made me believe in Santa Claus.

Let me explain! Around Y2K, I was in the later years of elementary school. Today, the school gets a 2/10 on the GreatSchools rating. I had not tested successfully into the GATE program, so I was not a "gifted" student. I barely had science education, and probably did not understand what "science" meant. During one winter break period, I had caught a commercial on TV that advertised Santa tracking by an entity called NORAD. This was in those days were AOL keywords were actually shown during television commercials, though short URLs were also common. I easily found the website that advertised the compelling promise, that one could actually track Santa around the world on Christmas Eve.

I was presented with these kinds of graphics and this kind of writing. This example is from the [NORAD Tracker website](https://web.archive.org/web/20041230202809/http://www.noradsanta.org/english/radar/index.html) from December 2004, notably the 50th year of this general tradition:

After studying the website in detail, my young self was confused. *Look at all these maps! Look at how Santa flew by the Eiffel Tower! These kinds of maps and pictures required so many resources from all these official sounding organizations.* The basic narrative that emerged, in the privacy of my own brain, during one winter break in San Diego, without access to school, teachers, scientists or anyone, was, "I thought Santa wasn't real...but now, I'm not sure." My first major exposure to the intersection of the Internet and science/technology made me question, for the first time in my life, whether or not Santa was real. Unbenknowst to me, it was my first time seeing science and technology commit to convincing the public of a falsehood.

In hindsight, it is painfully obvious that the webcam pictures and the videos weren't actully captured by cameras of some flying entity. In the year 2023, the Comic Sans MS and web design would have given it away.

In all seriousness, one can ask, to what degree can science be complicit in deception to accomplish its aims of general outreach? One can argue that there is no science presented here-- but there is. The maps are predictions, and the "real route" is different. This is why some webcam shots are successful and some are not. So, I want to explore the question: why would scientification organizations like NOAA be in cahoots with Santa Claus? Recently, NASA did not delay a mission to deliver human remains to the moon, ignoring concerns from the Navajo Nation, stating that "they don't bend to religious concerns". Major government scientific organizations choose to ignore the question of morality, and at the same time, the myth of Santa Claus is a 50+ year activity in the outreach activities of NORAD.

My guess is that the image of Santa Claus in the United States is a commercialized, marketed myth, reflecting a type of surveillance of year-round morality. Conveniently, the NORAD Santa Tracker makes a convincing case to worry about what Santa thinks about you. The success of NORAD in providing resources every year to convince people about Santa tracking is in line with the increased role of government in maintaining certain beliefs in greater society, which historically were in the purview of parents. In addition, it normalizes the possibility of surveillance of ocean, land and sky, for the purpose of locating Santa. It's a great testing ground for the military, as suggested in the book excerpt above.

In the week of Christmas 2023, the NORAD Santa Tracker website continued the yearly tradition of showing a map to track Santa, but also provided a hotline for inquiries. Had I known a few weeks ago, I would have called. My 10 year old self would have been too shy to ask. Today, I am intensely curious to know how technological and scientific vocabulary emerges in response to this burning question to the NORAD hotline: "Is this real?"
