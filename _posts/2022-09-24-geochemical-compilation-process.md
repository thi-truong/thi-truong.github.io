Sometimes I wonder if my data compilation process is too haphazard, random, and unorganized. So I will swing the other way and be overly organized and document my steps. I am not confident that this will help anyone else, but it will be useful for me when I inevitably retrace my steps to produce figures from the data that I compile. 

# Working across computers

I have a penchant for the program IgPet to make geochemical figures because of the ease of generating bivariate plots with minimal steps. On the superficial side, I like the default appearance of the plots. I really dislike Excel "shadows" and and not quite 1 pt lines! I think that IgPet also brings me closer to the goal of learning tidy data.

I have a primary Windows laptop that I use for dissertating (LaTeX, Zotero), data processing (Excel, sometimes play around with Python and SQL), and general use. I also am borrowing a MacBook Pro from my department, solely to use the program IgPet, for which my research group has a Mac OS X site license, but not one for Windows. I am still considering paying the $300 fee for a Windows site license, because you'll come to see the my brain can only tolerate a small level of things-being-in-several-places before I start to forget they exist, or that I was searching for those things to begin with.

Today, I am making a simple "mantle components"/endmember/reservoir (I should know this) diagram based on [Stracke et al. (2012)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000925411200366X), where there are plots showing such components, but no straightforward single value or uncertainty for them. So I must go fishing in the supplementary data to create my own. I acknowledge there are probably much more streamlined ways to do this, however, this process is likely to be a frequent one for me, even if I accomplish more efficient means in the future.

* Download the supplementary file, which has the amazing file name "1-s2.0-S000925411200366X-mmc1.xls". It goes into "My Downloads" folder on Windows.
* Move the file to Hawaiian Literature--> Supplementary Data Files-->rename to Stracke2012-supp-table-1. Get lost trying to find "open in new window" option in the huge Windows right click toolbar.
