00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Thank you for tuning in to my talk today about Lō‘ihi Seamount,
which is the youngest volcano of the Hawaiian Island chain. 

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Thi Truong and I'm presenting
research that I have done with my collaborators

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
David Graham, Mike Garcia and Peter Michael.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
To study Lō‘ihi, we must start with Hawai‘i.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
If we orient ourselves on the south coast of Hawai‘i...

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and move offshore about thirty kilometers,
we will see an underwater volcano 

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
at about a kilometer below the sea surface.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This is Lō‘ihi Seamount. It is a young volcano with
two rift zones, which developed early in its history.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Lō‘ihi has erupted a diversity of lava types
despite its short life.

10
00:00:41,000 -->  00:00:46,000
For these reasons, Lō‘ihi has transformed our understanding
of the earliest stage of Hawaiian volcanism

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
called the pre-shield stage.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
In addition, the presence of tholeiite basalt flows
indicate that a shield transition has already occurred or is ongoing. 

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Shown here is a summary of the methodological approach
to collect basaltic glasses for geochemical analyses.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Shown on the right is a 3D scan showing the interior
of a glass chip, where vesicles, or vapor bubbles are visible.

15
00:01:13,000 -->  00:01:20,000
These types of bubbles are composed mostly of CO2
and they are likely to host the majority of Helium, as well.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Early noble studies at Lō‘ihi have established that Lō‘ihi
has among the highest helium isotope values at a Hawaiian volcano.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This helium isotope value is believed to arise from the primordial
mantle input, that is, a deep mantle source which has obtained

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
chemical characteristics of an early Earth.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
At the same time, significant variation in helium isotopes
results in values as low as 20 RA, producing over 10 RA

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
difference of helium isotope values.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Because Lō‘ihi is close to the hypothesized melting region
of the Hawaiian plume, its variation sheds light not only

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
on the lesser understood pre-shield stage, but on the present day
distribution of chemical heterogeneities sampled by the Hawaiian plume.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Some explanations for the lower helium isotope values at Lō‘ihi
include intrinsic variation within the plume

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
radiogenic ingrowth of uranium (U) and thorium (Th),
as well as atmospheric and seawater contamination.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The addition of recycled components such as subduction
crustal materials may also account for the signature.

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Integrating Helium, carbon and water measurements of
quenched basaltic glass can be used to explore this hypothesis.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
However, most previous studies at Lō‘ihi have focused on the
shallow summit region where the retention of volatiles

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
from the mantle is a concern.

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
An expanded study of Lō‘ihi's deeply erupted glasses is needed.

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The objective of this study is to contribute a comprehensive data
set of coupled volatile measurements from over 40 basaltic glasses

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
collected from Lō‘ihi’s deep rift zone.

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Basaltic glasses were chosen because they represent erupted
melt compositions.

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Collection depths from 1300-5000-m beneath sea level means
that samples were erupted under relatively high confining pressure.

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
In contrast to the shallow summit, where gas loss is expected
to be more extensive, high pressure from the overlying water column

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
in the deep rift should promote the retention of magmatic volatiles.

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The majority of samples from Lō‘ihi with published Helium isotope
data do not have values determined by both crushing and melting.

37
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
In this study, Helium, and CO2 contents were measured from both
the melt and vesicle components to compute total contents,

38
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
which were used to evaluate relative behavior and partitioning.

39
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Water and trace element compositions were measured on
the melt components.

40
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
This dataset provides a means to evaluate the causes of 
volatile and helium isotope variations at Lō‘ihi Seamount.

41
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
For the rest of this talk, I will be presenting results
to address the following questions: 

42
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Is there systematic variation in helium isotopes at Lō‘ihi?

43
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Are CO2 and water contents heavily modified by degassing?

44
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Does elevated CO2/3He reflect the addition of recycled materials?

45
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And do trace element signatures support the addition of
recycled materials?

46
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Local variation at a single volcano will be useful to apply
to the broader scale, say, of the Hawaiian Islands

47
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
or the global high 3He/4He reservoir in the deep mantle.

48
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
For the rest of this talk, I will be using the same color
coding to indicate composition within the sample suite.

49
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
These designations are based on the normalized major
element composition of each glass relative to its position

50
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
along the MacDonald-Katsura line and based on alkalinity index.

51
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Within the South Rift zone of Lō‘ihi, alkali basalts
are shown in yellow

52
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
transitional basalts are shown in cyan or light blue,
and tholeiites are shown in red.

53
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
In the North Rift zone, three samples from the same dredge
are tholeiites. These are shown in orange.

54
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Helium isotope values are within the range of previous studies.

55
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
If we focus in on the results of the South Rift,
we see that mean 3He/4He values for tholeiites and

56
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
transitional basalts are different.

57
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Specifically, tholeiites are higher than transitional
basalts. They are different despite the fact that

58
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
they often have overlapping values.

59
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
This study does establish that the diversity of rock types
can be related to the diversity of helium isotope variation.

60
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It is also notable that the North Rift tholeiites in this 
study are higher in 3He compared to the South Rift tholeiites. 

61
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Moving on to carbon and water results, we see CO2
measurements vary greatly among Lō‘ihi deep rift samples.

62
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Comparing CO2 to a trace element like Barium (Ba)
indicates that samples have degassed by 95 to 99%.

63
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
That is, the least degassed samples have lost at least
95% of their original carbon inventory.

64
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Lō‘ihi samples are highly degassed, despite erupting
at great depths. However, water-potassium (H2O/K2O)

65
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
ratios suggest that dehydration has not occurred. 

66
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Multi-species element modeling with carbon and water
indicate that the least degassed samples correspond

67
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
to about 2.3 km equilibration depth.

68
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:33,000
To evaluate the extent of vapor-melt partitioning at Lō‘ihi,
we examined the CO2-He concentrations of the vesicles and the melt.

69
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
All of Lō‘ihi’s samples plot outside the equilibrium field
as indicated by Henry’s Law.

70
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Vesicle-melt partitioning suggests that helium diffuses faster
into bubbles than CO2.

71
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Another way to evaluate disequilibrium is to look at the CO2/3He ratio.

72
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,000
This ratio is said to be consistent across mid ocean ridge
and ocean Island basalt sources. Deviation from canonical

73
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
mantle ratios indicate potential recycling processes.

74
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:12,000
In our Lō‘ihi suite, we do see some elevated CO2/3He. This might
indicate recycled input due to elevated CO2.

75
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,000
However, our examination of vesicle-melt partitioning indicates
that non-equilibrium or kinetic degassing is likely to have occurred.

76
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Combining our results from vesicle-melt partitioning and the
CO2/3He ratio suggests the preferential loss of bubbles

77
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
has led to the loss of 3He.

78
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
This bubble loss will then drive the CO2/3He ratio upwards.

79
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Hence, the CO2/3He ratio may not reflect the source,
or recycled components. Instead, it reflects disequilibrium

80
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
degassing processes.

81
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,000
While integrated Helium-Carbon results may not support
recycled components in the Lō‘ihi source, some trace elements

82
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
are indicators of possible recycled material.

83
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
For example, we see slight positive anomalies in Nb and Ta. 

84
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Lō‘ihi is notable for its elevated Nb anomalies,
both in previous studies and this current study.

85
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Elevated Nb has been attributed to recycled crustal materials,
for example, eclogite in the mantle.

86
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:25,000
In addition, Nb/U ratios, which are typically consistent
across OIB and MORB are actually elevated at Lō‘ihi.

87
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
This indicates the possible enrichment from recycled materials.

88
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
In conclusion, the study yielded a number of results related to
volatiles at Lō‘ihi. 

89
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Helium systematically varies between rock types within the South Rift.

90
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Furthermore, the North Rift tholeiite samples have among the
highest 3He/4He measured for this whole dataset.

91
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
This suggests some spatial variability, at least in helium isotope
ratios between the North and the South Rift.

92
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Another major result is that C contents vary widely at Lō‘ihi,
and this is due to variable degassing of at least 95% of

93
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
the least degassed sample.

94
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Despite the loss of carbon, water loss has not occurred.

95
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Integrated helium and carbon results indicate that preferential
loss of helium may occur by bubble loss and non equilibrium,

96
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
or kinetic degassing.

97
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
In addition, trace element signatures may support the existence
of recycled materials. 

98
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Trace element results indicate that high-3He/4He samples also
have positive Nb anomalies. 

99
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
This supports the existence of recycled materials with primordial
material.

100
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
The trace element signature of Nb/U at Lō‘ihi is elevated compared
to global ocean Island and MORB sources.

101
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
This suggests the addition of enriched or altered material.

102
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Overall, the study sought to incorporate volatile measurements
and trace elements of a diverse set of lavas from Lō‘ihi Seamount

103
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
to constrain primordial and recycled components in the mantle source.

104
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I hope this talk has convinced you that local variation of a
single volcano can be used to understand broader scale processes

105
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
happening in the global mantle. Thank you for watching my talk.

106
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I also want to thank my collaborators, and I want to thank the
session conveners: Val Finlayson, James Dottin, and Jabrane Labidi

107
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
for inviting me to give this talk. Thank you to everyone who
made this work possible, and I look forward to seeing you

108
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
in the live session on Tuesday, December 14th.

109
00:10:33,000 --> 00:11:00,000
