Evidence of a well-mixed, but heterogeneous plume at Juan Fernández Islands. Lava samples from this small island group near Chile have puzzled geochemists since the 1980s. In the 1980s-early 1990s, mantle geochemists were beginning to construct the flavors of mantle endmembers that might be sampled by oceanic islands. Juan Fernández lavas exhibited an uncommon range of high and low-<sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He signatures. Yet, they displayed near-constant <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr and <sup>143</sup>Nd/<sup>144</sup>Nd isotopes. Solving for two possible mixing components with high and low <sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He but unchanging Sr-Nd isotopes was not possible.
