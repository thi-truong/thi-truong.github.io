My name is Thi Truong ("tee-troong", [hear name pronunciation](https://namedrop.io/thitruong)). I am currently a postdoctoral scholar at UC Irvine. I am originally from San Diego, California, and recently completed my PhD in Geology at Oregon State University.

## Research

I use geochemistry to understand processes that create anomalous, intraplate volcanism on Earth. My focus is on the creation and evolution of oceanic islands and seamounts, which are understood to contain signals of the mantle. 

My examinations focus on one type of rock (basalt), but considers the behavior of more than half of the elements listed of the periodic table! For specifics about my research objectives and results, check out my [research](https://thi-truong.github.io/research/).

Some of my interests:
* Scales of heterogeneity in the mantle and the signature in ocean island basalts
* Origin and behavior of volatiles and their distribution in the solid Earth
* How the mantle plume hypothesis holds up over time, across global studies, in the study of intraplate ocean islands

## Teaching and Practice

My teaching philosophy focuses on generating authentic connections with the practice of science and scientific thinking. While teaching concepts, I emphasize geology as a historical science, the social aspect of scientific communities, and the role of consensus. I am also interested in the origin of geoscience misconceptions (especially about plate tectonics and Earth's interior), and ways to address and disrupt their persistence.

[comment]: # (Scientific advances reflect the work of scholarly communities, whether they are equitable or not. I invite the geoscience community to engage in these questions with me: If Geology is a global science, then why is exclusion the norm? How can we dismantle this exclusion today? I seek to answer such questions over the course of my career.)
