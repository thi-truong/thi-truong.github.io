My name is Thi Truong ([hear pronunciation](https://namedrop.io/thitruong)).

I am currently a PhD Candidate in Geology at Oregon State University. I am originally from San Diego, California.

I use geochemistry to understand processes that create anomalous, intraplate volcanism on Earth. My focus is on the creation and evolution of oceanic islands and seamounts. I collect high-precision data of elements occurring in the tiniest concentrations (parts per million to parts per billion) in lava rocks or minerals. My examinations focus on one type of rock (basalt), but considers the behavior of more than half of the elements listed on the periodic table. 

Intellectual contributions cannot be separated from communities of scholars, and I invite the community to address the following question: If Geology is a global science, then why is exclusion the norm? How can we dismantle this exclusion today? I seek to answer such questions over the course of my career.
