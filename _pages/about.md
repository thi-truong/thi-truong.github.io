About Me
======
My name is Thi Truong ([pronunciation](https://namedrop.io/thitruong)). I am currently a PhD Candidate in Geology at Oregon State University.

I apply geochemistry (the chemical analysis of erupted products like rocks, minerals, fluids) to understand processes that create anomalous, intraplate volcanism on Earth. I accomplish this by collecting high-precision data of elements occurring in the tiniest concentrations (parts per million to parts per billion) in lava rocks. Specifically, I look at noble gases and high-temperature elements. 

Ultimately, my work reflects on the utility of the mantle plume model, which seeks to explain the origin of places like the Hawaiian Islands, Iceland, Galapagos, etc.

Questions I have been thinking about lately
======
* How do we dismantle a field based on colonial theft and land dispossession?
* How can history and philosophy of geochemistry guide us in our collaborations for the next big synthesis of the interior?
* How do we teach science without scientism?
* Who gets excluded in studies about unobservable reality? Who is deemed an authority, and why?
* How often do misconceptions in geology relate to visualization and models, or erroneous, but persistent messaging from scientific authorities and materials?
