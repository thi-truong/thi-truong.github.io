My name is Thi Truong ([hear name pronunciation](https://namedrop.io/thitruong)). I use geochemistry to understand processes that create anomalous, intraplate volcanism on Earth. My focus is on the creation and evolution of oceanic islands and seamounts, which are understood to contain signals of the mantle. 

I am currently a PhD Candidate in Geology at Oregon State University. I am originally from San Diego, California.

My examinations focus on one type of rock (basalt), but considers the behavior of more than half of the elements listed of the periodic table! For specifics about my research objectives and results, check out my [research page](https://thi-truong.github.io/research/).

Some of my interests:
* Scales of heterogeneity in the mantle and the signature in ocean island basalts
* Origin and behavior of volatiles and their distribution in the solid Earth
* How the mantle plume hypothesis holds up over time, across global studies, in the study of intraplate ocean islands

# Teaching

My teaching philosophy focuses on generating authentic connections with the practice of science and scientific thinking. For laboratory settings, I create opportunities for students to practice "seeing" and recognizing patterns, while being sensitive to disability and strategies to incorporate universal design. While teaching concepts, I emphasize geology as a historical science, the social aspect of scientific communities, and the role of consensus. I am also interested in the origin of geoscience misconceptions (especially about plate tectonics and Earth's interior), and ways to address and disrupt their persistence.

# Questions I'm thinking about

Scientific advances reflect the work of scholarly communities, whether they are equitable or not. I invite the geoscience community to engage in these questions with me:

* If Geology is a global science, then why is exclusion the norm? 
* How can we dismantle this exclusion today?
* How can history and philosophy of geochemistry guide us in our collaborations for the next big synthesis of the interior?

I seek to answer such questions over the course of my career.
