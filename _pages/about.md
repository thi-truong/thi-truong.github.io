This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

About Me
======
My name is Thi Truong ([pronunciation](https://namedrop.io/thitruong)). I am currently a PhD Candidate in Geology at Oregon State University.

I apply geochemistry (the chemical analysis of erupted products like rocks, minerals, fluids) to understand processes that create anomalous, intraplate volcanism on Earth. I accomplish this by collecting high-precision data of elements occurring in the tiniest concentrations (parts per million to parts per billion) in lava rocks. Specifically, I look at noble gases and high-temperature elements. 

Ultimately, my work reflects on the utility of the mantle plume model, which seeks to explain the origin of places like the Hawaiian Islands, Iceland, Galapagos, etc.

Questions I have been thinking about lately
======
* How do we dismantle a field based on colonial theft and land dispossession?
* How can history and philosophy of geochemistry guide us in our collaborations for the next big synthesis of the interior?
* How do we teach science without scientism?
* Who gets excluded in studies about unobservable reality? Who is deemed an authority, and why?
* How often do misconceptions in geology relate to visualization and models, or erroneous, but persistent messaging from scientific authorities and materials?
