My name is Thi Truong ([hear name pronunciation](https://namedrop.io/thitruong)). I use geochemistry to understand processes that create anomalous, intraplate volcanism on Earth. My focus is on the creation and evolution of oceanic islands and seamounts, which are understood to contain signals of the mantle. 

I am currently a PhD Candidate in Geology at Oregon State University. I am originally from San Diego, California.

My examinations focus on one type of rock (basalt), but considers the behavior of more than half of the elements listed of the periodic table! For specifics about my research objectives and results, check out my [research page](https://thi-truong.github.io/research/).

Some of my interests:
* Origin and behavior of volatiles and their distribution in the solid Earth
* Scales of heterogeneity in the mantle and the signature in ocean island basalts
* How the mantle plume hypothesis holds up over time, across global studies, for assessing hotspot volcanism

# Teaching and practice

My teaching philosophy focuses on generating authentic connections with the practice of science, rather than appealing to the image of science, or scientism. I aim to improve learning outcomes in geology by applying recommendations from broader STEM education fields, while emphasizing the unique aspects of geology as a historical science.

Another important point to emphasize is that scientific contributions are the result of engagement with scholarly communities, and I invite today's community to address these questions with me:

* If Geology is a global science, then why is exclusion the norm? 
* How can we dismantle this exclusion today?

I seek to answer such questions over the course of my career. Learn about some of my [contributions to social justice and education](https://thi-truong.github.io/contributions/).
