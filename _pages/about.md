My name is Thi Truong ([hear pronunciation](https://namedrop.io/thitruong)).

I am currently a PhD Candidate in Geology at Oregon State University. I am originally from San Diego, California.

My research revolves around the central question:
* What are mantle plumes made of?
* What can we know about these basically unobservable entities in the Earth's solid interior?

I use geochemistry to understand processes that create anomalous, intraplate volcanism on Earth. My focus is on the creation and evolution of oceanic islands and seamounts, which are understood to contain signals of the mantle. I collect high-precision data of elements occurring in the tiniest concentrations (sometimes to the parts per billion level) in lava rocks or minerals. My examinations focus on one type of rock (basalt), but considers the behavior of more than half of the elements listed of the periodic table.

For specifics about my research objectives and results, check out my [research page](https://thi-truong.github.io/publications/).


My teaching philosophy focuses on generating authentic connections with the practice of science, rather than appealing to the image of science, or scientism. Intellectual contributions cannot be separated from communities of scholars, and I invite the community to address these questions with me:

* If Geology is a global science, then why is exclusion the norm?
* How can we dismantle this exclusion today?

I seek to answer such questions over the course of my career. Learn about some of my [contributions to social justice and education](https://thi-truong.github.io/contributions/).
