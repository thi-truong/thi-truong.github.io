Research activities

# Juan Fern√°ndez Islands
## Evidence of a well-mixed, but heterogeneous plume

Trace element compositions, Sr-Nd-Pb isotopes of lavas and Sr-Nd of olivines indicate variable sampling of a dominantly FOZO-like source during shield and post-shield volcanic stages. Published in Chemical Geology

# Loihi Seamount
## Behavior of He-C, trace elements of Loihi's deep rift zone

Description

## Spatial variability of Pb isotopes at a young pre-shield volcano

Of course I am still talking about Loihi
