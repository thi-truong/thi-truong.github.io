# Juan Fern√°ndez Islands

These are an enigmatic group of islands off the coast of Chile.

## Evidence of a well-mixed, but heterogeneous plume

![Figure showing geologic evolution of the Juan Fernandez Islands in 4 subfigures. A. Pre-shield (lava and source compositions poorly constrained). Depicts grey plume interacting with thin block of lithosphere producing small volcanoes. Arrow to the right and Nazca 6 cm/yr depicting plate motion to the next figure. B. Early phase shield (large degrees of partial melting of FOZO plus ~depleted source: Group III basalts). Depicts larger plume beneath slightly flexed lithosphere with small degree pre-shield covered by dome-shaped structure. C. Late phase shield (lesser degree of partial melting of FOZO source: Group I Basalts). Depicts smaller plume that is still ponded beneath lithosphere, and dashed arrows show outline of previous shield phase structure, which are covered by recent additions of lava. Arrow to the right. D. Rejuvenated (small degree of partial melting of FOZO + fractional crytallization: Group II basanites. Depicts small, isolated areas of volcanism and new pre-shield phase to the left (opposite plate movement direction) as plate motion has moved the volcano off the plume)](images/research-figure01-juan-fernandez-geologic-evolution.png)

Trace element compositions, Sr-Nd-Pb isotopes of lavas and Sr-Nd of olivines indicate variable sampling of a dominantly FOZO-like source during shield and post-shield volcanic stages. Published in Chemical Geology

# Loihi Seamount

This is the baby of the Hawaiian Islands. 

## Behavior of He-C, trace elements of Loihi's deep rift zone

Description

## Spatial variability of Pb isotopes

Of course I am still talking about Loihi
