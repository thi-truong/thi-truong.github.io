# Juan Fern√°ndez Islands

These are an enigmatic group of islands off the coast of Chile.

## Evidence of a well-mixed, but heterogeneous plume

Trace element compositions, Sr-Nd-Pb isotopes of lavas and Sr-Nd of olivines indicate variable sampling of a dominantly FOZO-like source during shield and post-shield volcanic stages. Published in Chemical Geology

# Loihi Seamount

This is the baby of the Hawaiian Islands. 

## Behavior of He-C, trace elements of Loihi's deep rift zone

Description

## Spatial variability of Pb isotopes

Of course I am still talking about Loihi
