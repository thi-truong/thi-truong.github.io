Bottom middle shows map view of subaerial islands, and cross-section showing topography and bathymetric features (depth in m). The island on the right, Robinson Crusoe (Mas a Tierra) consists of group I and II lavas which represent a late shield-building stage and post-shield phase. The island on the left, Alexander Selkirk (Mas Afuera) consists of Group III basalts which represent the shield phase." width="600px">
