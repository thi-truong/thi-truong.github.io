**Motivation**: By the late 1980s, mantle geochemists constructed various flavors of mantle endmember compositions within oceanic island lavas [^1]. Explorations of the historically uninhabited Juan Fernandez Islands[^2] near the coast of Chile revealed basalts containing a large volume of olivine crystals[^3]. The coarse olivines were promising candidates for Helium isotope analyses. A range of <sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He=12-18 R<sub>A</sub> on the older, larger island, was consistent with a deeply sourced mantle plume. However, the younger island were more restricted in their range, and the range was similar to MORB lavas=8-11 R<sub>A</sub>[^4]. Sr-Nd isotopes measured in lavas were homogeneous, and inconsistent with MORB-OIB mixing. Oxygen isotopes were typical of other high-<sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He localities[^5]. Skeptics of deep mantle plume sources proposed a xenocryst origin of the olivines, where the Helium isotope ratios were from volatiles pervading shallow magma chambers [^6]. 

**Research Questions**: Are the olivines from the same mantle source as the lavas? Are Pb isotopes similar to other SE Pacific Islands, showing enriched mantle input? Would trace elements reveal differences in magmatic evolution between the older and younger island? Are isotopic ratios, overall, a product of mantle plume evolution or variation, or mixing with MORB mantle? 

We found that the mantle source of Juan Fernández is heterogeneous but well-mixed and can be characterized as dominantly FOZO. Low-<sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He samples need not derive from depleted mantle material, and the isotope signature of Alexander Selkirk late stage basalts depict a possible EM2 source. Overall, the trace element compositions, Sr-Nd-Pb isotopes of lavas and Sr-Nd of olivines indicate variable sampling of a dominantly FOZO-like source during shield and post-shield volcanic stages.
