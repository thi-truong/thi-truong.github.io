These are an enigmatic group of islands off the coast of Chile. They are historically uninhabited, aside from goats, lobsters, and a poor shipwrecked soul. Picrites (basalts with a significant volume % of olivines) were originally termed *masafuerites*, named after the specimens found here. 

Lava samples from this small island group near Chile have puzzled geochemists since the 1980s. By the early 1990s, mantle geochemists constructed various flavors of mantle endmember compositions that might be sampled by oceanic islands. **[Learn more about my research question and findings](juan-fernandez)**

Bottom middle shows map view of subaerial islands, and cross-section showing topography and bathymetric features (depth in m). The island on the right, Robinson Crusoe (Mas a Tierra) consists of group I and II lavas which represent a late shield-building stage and post-shield phase. The island on the left, Alexander Selkirk (Mas Afuera) consists of Group III basalts which represent the shield phase." width="600px">

# Loihi Seamount

This is the baby of the Hawaiian Islands. 

## Behavior of He-C, trace elements of Loihi's deep rift zone

Description

## Spatial variability of Pb isotopes

Of course I am still talking about Loihi
