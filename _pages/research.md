## Spatial variability of Pb isotopes (current/upcoming)

Suite of Pb isotopes will be collected to test for heterogeneity the underlying mantle source.

These are an enigmatic group of islands off the coast of Chile. They are historically uninhabited, aside from goats, lobsters, and a poor shipwrecked soul. Picrites (basalts with a significant volume % of olivines) were originally termed *masafuerites*, named after the specimens found here. Lava samples from this small island group near Chile have puzzled geochemists since the 1980s. By the early 1990s, mantle geochemists constructed various flavors of mantle endmember compositions that might be sampled by oceanic islands. 

We found that the mantle source of Juan Fernández is heterogeneous but well-mixed and can be characterized as dominantly FOZO. Low-<sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He samples need not derive from depleted mantle material, and the isotope signature of Alexander Selkirk late stage basalts depict a possible EM2 source. Overall, the trace element compositions, Sr-Nd-Pb isotopes of lavas and Sr-Nd of olivines indicate variable sampling of a dominantly FOZO-like source during shield and post-shield volcanic stages.
