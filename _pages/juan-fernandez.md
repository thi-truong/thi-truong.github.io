**Motivation and Context**:
By the late 1980s, mantle geochemists constructed various flavors of mantle endmember compositions within oceanic island lavas [^1]. Explorations of the historically uninhabited Juan Fernandez Islands[^2] near the coast of Chile revealed basalts containing a large volume of olivine crystals[^3]. The coarse olivines were promising candidates for Helium isotope analyses. A range of <sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He=12-18 R<sub>A</sub> from the older, larger island, was consistent with a deeply sourced mantle plume. However, lavas from the younger island exhibited a narrow range similar to MORB = 8-11 R<sub>A</sub>[^4]. Sr-Nd isotopes measured in lavas were homogeneous, yet inconsistent with MORB-OIB mixing. Another study of global oxygen isotopes grouped Juan Fernandez with other high-<sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He localities, for their similar ratios [^5]. Skeptics of deep mantle plume sources proposed a xenocryst origin of the olivines, where the Helium isotope ratios were from volatiles pervading shallow magma chambers [^6]. 

**Research Questions**:
* Are the olivines from the same mantle source as the lavas?
* Ae Pb isotopes similar to other SE Pacific Islands, showing enriched mantle input?
* Do trace elements reveal differences in magmatic evolution between the older and younger island?
* Are isotopic ratios, overall, a product of mantle plume evolution or variation, or mixing with MORB mantle? 

**Summary**:
Olivine crystals were separated and analyzed for Sr-Nd isotopes. Their ratios were within error to the mafic lavas (published values). Assuming similar D<sub>He</sub> and D<sub>Nd</sub>, this is consistent with olivines forming in equilibrium with the lava suite. Pb isotopes show a heterogeneous but well-mixed mantle source that can be characterized as predominantly FOZO component. The Pb isotope signature of the younger island, reflect a possible EM2 source, and need not derive from depleted mantle. The evolution of the younger island can be described as late shield stage, where diminsihing plume influence results in low <sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He. Overall, the trace element compositions, Sr-Nd-Pb isotopes of lavas and Sr-Nd of olivines indicate variable sampling of a dominantly FOZO-like source during shield, late stage shield, and post-shield construction among the two islands.
