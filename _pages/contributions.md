# Highlights from teaching, leadership, outreach activities

I am interested in pedagogy and increasing accessibility in the geosciences. I am also interested in teaching with historical case studies when teaching geology. Below are some of my contributions to social justice in STEM, materials prepared for introductory college and university upper-division teaching, and results from K-12 outreach activities.

## Education and visualization
  
   One problem with geology is reliance on visual phenomena without explicit regard for descriptive vs. explanatory definitions. 
 
### Tutorial to aid microscope interpretation

### Assessing understanding of bathymetric features in 2YC lab

Survey of introductory community college students found that students easily named exaggerated phenomena.
 
 ## Social justice and integrating expert facilitation in STEM settings

### 2021 Unpacking Diversity Public Keynote Event with Dr. Aradhna Tripati (UCLA)
  
  Embed the Youtube video
  
  Co-organized 2-day virtual keynote which was attended by many.
  
  * Funding total of $5k and engaged new stakeholders with OSU
  * Attendance from X countries
  * Organized Women of Color in Geosciences panel
  * Total of 10(?) events including undergraduate workshop (participants were able to get Amazon gift cards for attending the virutal workshop), departmental talk, meetings with various stakeholders
   Co-organized many lectures and experimented with engagement.
   
### A long track record engagement (in-person and virtual), prioritizing accessibility, promoting care

Unpacking Diversity Learning Community, 2018-2021.

Organized total of 16+? events. 600+ people engaged. Organized in a way to promote facilitation and avoid tokenizing. Created high standards and facilitated learning about social justice in STEM.

* SACNAS presentation
* Ocean Sciences Meeting
   
### Reporting new NSF demographic data to share with the geoscience community
  
Inspired by Dr. Rachel Bernard's paper, No progress in geoscience for 40 years, and her blog from when she was a PhD student, it was evident that data from 1973-2016 showed a dismal outcome for Black and Indigineous students in the geosciences. When new data was released in 2020, I was motivated to see if two years of additional data (2017, 2018) would show the same trend. I shared the plots on the Unpacking Diversity Twitter.
  
  It was shared X times and featured in an NSF Ocean Sciences future panel and a forthcoming ecology presentation. And I think in one other place but I can't remember.

## Geology outreach (without explosions or volcanoes)

### Birthstones/Gemstones activity for K-12 and first year college students
  
Developing outreach exercise that doesn't rely on explosions? Birthstone/Gemstone based educational exercise for Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation at OSU

## History/Philosophy of Geology
  
### Anomalous volcanism presentation at GSA/INHIGEO

Promoting history for a historical science. Presented at INHIGEO and attended section meeting. Still believe Feyerabend.
