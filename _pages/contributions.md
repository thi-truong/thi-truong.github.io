Below are some of my materials prepared for introductory college and university upper-division teaching, and recent contributions to social justice in STEM. 

# Example tutorial for optical mineralogy students

Left side shows straight lines across light background. This is clinopyroxene under plane polarized light. Right side shows same view under cross polarized light where the light areas are now all dark. This indicates that this is clinopyroxene, because the lines do not align vertically, but are diagonal.">

Instructional video for undergraduate optical mineralogy students to distinguish between clinopyroxene/orthopyroxene in thin section. No sound. [Link to YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muPhXJS_qwk/) or click thumbnail above.

## Sample narrative for teaching
> This video shows how one might use cleavage traces of two unknown pyroxene minerals for identification. Set up the view of the mineral in plane polarized light.
> 
> 1. Locate cleavage traces (dark lines) and align them so they are vertically aligned up/down with crosshairs. This is the starting angle.
> 2. Switch to cross-polarized light and observe if extinction occurs while remaining in this view.
> 3. If the mineral is extinct, then 0 degrees of rotation was needed to observe extinction. The extinction angle is 0. This indicates orthopyroxene (see note).
> 4. If I must rotate the stage to see extinction, then this means the extinction angle is greater than 0. This indicates inclined extinction, and the mineral is clinopyroxene  (see note).
>
> Note: Looking down the {100} face of clionopyroxene may produce parallel extinction. Be sure to examine several grains and use other diagnostic observations to support your identification.



# 2021 Unpacking Diversity Public Keynote Event with Dr. Aradhna Tripati (UCLA)

Held in May 2021, the positive engagement reflects my continued effort to engage the community, prioritize accessibility, ensure care for students, and create opportunities to engage with stakeholders. I managed technical aspects of webinar broadcasting, livestreaming, and accessibility.

## Roles
* Developed event timeline and communicated with various stakeholders throughout the entire planning process
* Coordinated keynote talk accommodations and ensured digital advertisements and announcements were accessible
* Also organized scientific talk to the department, undergraduate student workshop, and Women of Color discussion panel with 3 invited guest scientists.

## Outcomes

* Acquired funding from eight sponsors, including on-campus and state organizations.
* Over 163 attended the Zoom Webinar, representing 22 institutions/organizations other than Oregon State University and from 5 countries.
* 18 additional viewers joined the YouTube livestream.

# Compiling demographic data for the geoscience community
  
<a href="/images/NSF-Table-16-Earth-Sciences-doctorate-data.png"><img src="/images/NSF-Table-16-Earth-Sciences-doctorate-data.png" style="width:600px" alt="Graph showing number of U.S. Doctorates in Earth Sciences, by ethnicity. X-axis shows years 2008 to 2018. Y-axis shows number of degree recipients, from 0 to 400. Dots connected by lines are color coded to show different ethnicities: Black - Total, Grey - White, Purple - Hispanic or Latino, Black or African-American, Orange - Asian, Green - Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Blue - More than one race, Gold - American Indian or Alaska Native. In 2008, the total number of degree recipients was around 275, with white recipients accounting for nearly 250. In 2018, total recipients increased to about 375. White recipients make up over 300 of those recipients. Almost no change observed from 2016 to 2018.">

Inspired by Dr. Rachel Bernard's paper, [No progress in geoscience for 40 years](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-018-0116-6), and [her blog post during her PhD years](https://www.jsg.utexas.edu/science-yall/who-gets-geology-phds/), it was evident that data from 1973-2016 showed a dismal outcome for Black and Indigineous students in the geosciences. When new data from the [NSF Survey of Earned Doctorates](https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/srvydoctorates/) was released in 2020, I was motivated to see if two years of additional data (2017, 2018) would show the same trends that Dr. Bernard found. I compiled the new data and created these plots to assess if progress had occurred since 2016. These were shared on the Unpacking Diversity Twitter.

Example of data for Earth Sciences majors shown above. View the full set of plots in the [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/UnpkngDIVERSITY/status/1273507530509959168).

Results have been featured in a number of presentations:
* Dr Hilary Palevsky's presentation during NSF Ocean Sciences virtual symposium "The Future of the Oceans" in June 2020.
* Andy Lee and Erin de Leon Sanchez' presentation: "Nuances of Asian American experiences in ecology and evolutionary biology" in October 2021
