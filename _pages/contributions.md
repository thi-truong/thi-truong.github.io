# Highlights from teaching, leadership, outreach activities

I am interested in pedagogy and increasing accessibility in the geosciences. I am also interested in teaching with historical case studies when teaching geology. Below are some of my contributions to social justice in STEM, materials prepared for introductory college and university upper-division teaching, and results from K-12 outreach activities.

  ## Translating geoscience visuals in a sea of pictures
  
One problem with geology is reliance on visual phenomena without explicit regard for descriptive vs. explanatory definitions.

  Survey of introductory community college students found that students easily named exaggerated phenomena.

  <summary><b>Reporting new NSF demographic data to share with the geoscience community </b></summary>
  
  ## Reporting data from NSF Earned Doctorates report in 2020
  
Inspired by Dr. Rachel Bernard's paper, No progress in geoscience for 40 years, and her blog from when she was a PhD student, it was evident that data from 1973-2016 showed a dismal outcome for Black and Indigineous students in the geosciences. When new data was released in 2020, I was motivated to see if two years of additional data (2017, 2018) would show the same trend. I shared the plots on the Unpacking Diversity Twitter.
  
  It was shared X times and featured in an NSF Ocean Sciences future panel and a forthcoming ecology presentation. And I think in one other place but I can't remember.
 
See the results in the [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/UnpkngDIVERSITY/status/1273507530509959168). Suggested credit for images: "Thi Truong, on behalf of @UnpkngDIVERSITY at OSU (2020)". [E-mail me](mailto:truonthi@oregonstate.edu) to request full-size images for presentation or other use.
