Below are some of my materials prepared for introductory college and university upper-division teaching, and recent contributions to social justice in STEM. I have taught laboratory components of oceanography, mineralogy, petrology, and general geology classes.


# Example tutorial for optical mineralogy students

Left side shows straight lines across light background. This is clinopyroxene under plane polarized light. Right side shows same view under cross polarized light where the light areas are now all dark. This indicates that this is clinopyroxene, because the lines do not align vertically, but are diagonal.">

Instructional video for undergraduate optical mineralogy students to distinguish between clinopyroxene/orthopyroxene in thin section. No sound. [Link to YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muPhXJS_qwk/) or click thumbnail above.

<summary>Sample narrative for teaching</summary>

> This video shows how one might use cleavage traces of two unknown pyroxene minerals for identification. Set up the view of the mineral in plane polarized light.
> 
> 1. Locate cleavage traces (dark lines) and align them so they are vertically aligned up/down with crosshairs. This is the starting angle.
> 2. Switch to cross-polarized light and observe if extinction occurs while remaining in this view.
> 3. If the mineral is extinct, then 0 degrees of rotation was needed to observe extinction. The extinction angle is 0. This indicates orthopyroxene (see note).
> 4. If I must rotate the stage to see extinction, then this means the extinction angle is greater than 0. This indicates inclined extinction, and the mineral is clinopyroxene  (see note).
>
> Note: Looking down the {100} face of clionopyroxene may produce parallel extinction. Be sure to examine several grains and use other diagnostic observations to support your identification.

# 2021 Unpacking Diversity Keynote Event with Dr. Aradhna Tripati

I coordinated multiple aspects of event, from initial conception of in-person event in October 2019 to execution of virtual event in May 2021. The first year's planning efforts resulted in an original date, late May 2020. After much uncertainty amidst the pandemic, we successfully held the event during a 2-day "virtual" keynote visit, with ~$1,000 more support than the previous year, thanks to co-sponsorship by additional campus and off-campus stakeholders. To ensure audience engagement during the virtual event, the budget included accommodations for the keynote event and undergraduate student participation in a workshop. This event reflects continued efforts and success in delivering relevant and timely educational events, whether they are in-person, hybrid, or virtual.

For more information, see the [Unpacking Diversity Keynote 2021 page](https://unpackingdiversity.wixsite.com/ceoas/keynote-2021), which lists other events hosted as part of the 2-day event.

<details>
<summary>Roles</summary>
*  Created and maintained project planning document and timelines. Led communication with speaker, vendors, on-campus and external stakeholders, and revised plans and timelines as needed throughout the process
* Prioritized accommodations in the budget, communicated with OSU DAS to coordinate appropriate vendors for captioning/ASL interpreters. Prepared event glossary and introduction script.
* Ran keynote event with Zoom Webinar500 platform, set up registration page and backend settings for webinar, wrote scripts, prepared run-of-show documents, tested event with captioners and interpreters and test users, set up livestreaming options.

<details>
<summary>Outcomes</summary>

* Acquired $6,000 funding from eight sponsors, including on-campus and state organizations.
* Over 163 attended the Zoom Webinar, representing 22 institutions/organizations outside of Oregon State University, and from 5 countries.
* 18 additional viewers joined the YouTube livestream.
* The 2-day virtual visit included a technical talk for the Geology & Geophysics departmental seminar, an undergraduate student workshop, a Women of Color discussion panel with 3 invited guest scientists, and a number of meetings with community members and organizations.

# Compiling demographic data for the geoscience community
   
Inspired by Dr. Rachel Bernard's paper, [No progress in geoscience for 40 years](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-018-0116-6), and [her blog post during her PhD years](https://www.jsg.utexas.edu/science-yall/who-gets-geology-phds/), it was evident that data from 1973-2016 showed a dismal outcome for Black and Indigineous students in the geosciences.

When new data from the [NSF Survey of Earned Doctorates](https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/srvydoctorates/) was released in 2020, I was motivated to see if two years of additional data (2017, 2018) would show the same trends that Dr. Bernard found. I compiled the new data and created these plots to assess if progress had occurred since 2016. These were shared on the Unpacking Diversity Twitter.

<a href="/images/NSF-Table-16-Earth-Sciences-doctorate-data.png"><img src="/images/NSF-Table-16-Earth-Sciences-doctorate-data.png" style="width:400px" alt="Graph showing number of U.S. Doctorates in Earth Sciences, by ethnicity. X-axis shows years 2008 to 2018. Y-axis shows number of degree recipients, from 0 to 400. Dots connected by lines are color coded to show different ethnicities: Black - Total, Grey - White, Purple - Hispanic or Latino, Black or African-American, Orange - Asian, Green - Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Blue - More than one race, Gold - American Indian or Alaska Native. In 2008, the total number of degree recipients was around 275, with white recipients accounting for nearly 250. In 2018, total recipients increased to about 375. White recipients make up over 300 of those recipients. Almost no change observed from 2016 to 2018.">

Example of data for Earth Sciences majors shown above. View the full set of plots in the [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/UnpkngDIVERSITY/status/1273507530509959168).

Results have been featured in a number of presentations:
* [NSF Ocean Sciences "Frontiers of Ocean Sciences" virtual symposium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI2TTOeA0Tk) in June 2020 (presenter: Dr. Hilary Palevsky)
* "Nuances of Asian American experiences in ecology and evolutionary biology" talk in October 2021 (presenters: Andy Lee and Erin de Leon Sanchez)
