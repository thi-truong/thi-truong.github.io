# Highlights from teaching, leadership, outreach activities

I am interested in pedagogy and increasing accessibility in the geosciences. I am also interested in teaching with historical case studies when teaching geology. Below are some of my contributions to social justice in STEM, materials prepared for introductory college and university upper-division teaching, and results from K-12 outreach activities.
