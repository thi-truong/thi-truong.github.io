excerpt: "Teaching Philosophy"

**My teaching philosophy focuses on the unrealized potential of Geology to inform 21st century learners towards a global community of problem-solving. I draw from history/philosophy of science, science education, the psychology of learning, and the modern misinformation crisis to address this education gap.**

Geology departments at institutions of higher learning are experiencing a recruitment crisis. Geology is among the least racially diverse STEM fields, is built on a history of gender exclusion, and has among the lowest enrollment of students with disabilities. From elementary school to high school, most fundamental geology concepts are taught with erroneous and obvious errors.

Meanwhile, the largest problems facing society are rooted in Geology: climate change, resource extraction, the lack of livable and safe regions on Earth to live, are all issues that occupy concerned citizens. The nuances of scientific crises are often surrendered to scientists as experts. Scientists are glorified for their access to establishing "truth" about the natural world. At the same time, they are villified when those truths are revisited, challenged, and collapse over time. This is the flip side to scientism, which describes a dogmatic prestige of science as a source of knowledge. What scientists achieve in unchallenged expertise and a respect for titles is quickly taken away when responsibility to respond to a new crisis outweighs theory.

As someone who was educated in a post-Plate Tectonics theory world with an exclusively Houghton Mifflin/Springer dominated market of educational materials, No Child Left Behind, and a collapse of higher education's appeal to the average person, my immediate reaction to most geoloIgy education, whether has been delivered to me, or I have been tasked with delivering it, is that it is usually incompatible to the neeeds of the modern student who has little previous experience with the topic. The incompatibility continues into graduate school. As specialization closes off access to information, even people with advanced geology degrees cannot unpack the problems of similar disciplines.

Historically, the most significant contributions to knowledge about Geology has never been done by someone who majored in Geology. Though I make this comment in the spirit of jest, the realization that more outsiders have contributed to Geology than insiders is reassuring for someone like me, who did not feel like she belonged in Geology, even while sitting in a *graduate-level Geology course*. 

My solution to this concrete barrier of access is to abandon the standard narrative of textbook science, and teach geology by incorporating history and humanism.
