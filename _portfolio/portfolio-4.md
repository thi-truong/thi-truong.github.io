excerpt: "Teaching Philosophy"
---

My teaching philosophy focuses on the unrealized potential of Geology to inform 21st century learners towards a global community of problem-solving for humans. I draw from history/philosophy of science, science education, the psychology of learning, and the modern disinformation crisis to inform my teaching position and actions.

Historically, the most significant contributions to knowledge about Geology has never been done by someone who majored in Geology. Though I make this comment in the spirit of jest, I think the realization that more outsiders have contributed to Geology than insiders is reassuring for someone like me, who did not feel like she belonged in Geology, even while sitting in a *graduate-level Geology course*.

Geology departments at institutions of higher learning are experiencing a recruitment crisis. Geology is among the least racially diverse STEM fields, is built on a history of gender exclusion, and has among the lowest enrollment of students with disabilities. From elementary school to high school, most fundamental geology concepts are taught with erroneous and obvious errors. Meanwhile, the largest problems facing society are rooted in Geology: climate change, resource extraction, the lack of livable and safe regions on Earth to live, the carbon cycle. 

The nuances of scientific crises are often surrendered to scientists as experts, as the average citizen cannot devote their life to understanding the intricacies of complicated scientific problems. As a result, scientists are glorified for their access to establishing "truth" about the natural world. At the same time, they are villified when those truths are revisited, challenged, and collapse over time. This is the flip side to scientism, which describes a dogmatic prestige of science as a source of knowledge. What scientists achieve in unchallenged expertise and a respect for titles is quickly taken away when responsibility to respond to a new crisis outweighs theory.

There is a solution to this, and this lies in history and humanism.
