**My teaching philosophy focuses on the unrealized potential of Geology to inform 21st century learners towards a global community of problem-solving. I draw from history/philosophy of science, science education, the psychology of learning, and the modern misinformation crisis to address this education gap.**

**Unrealized potential**

Geology departments at institutions of higher learning are experiencing a recruitment crisis. Geology is among the least racially diverse STEM fields, is built on a history of gender exclusion, and has among the lowest enrollment of students with disabilities. From elementary school to high school, most fundamental geology concepts are taught with erroneous and obvious errors.

Meanwhile, the largest problems facing society are rooted in Geology: climate change, resource extraction, the lack of livable and safe regions on Earth to live, are all issues that occupy concerned citizens. The nuances of scientific crises are often surrendered to scientists as experts. Scientists are glorified for their access to establishing "truth" about the natural world. At the same time, they are villified when those truths are revisited, challenged, and collapse over time. This is the flip side to scientism, which describes a dogmatic prestige of science as a source of knowledge. What scientists achieve in unchallenged expertise and a respect for titles is quickly taken away when responsibility to respond to a new crisis outweighs theory.

As someone who was educated in a post-Plate Tectonics theory world with an exclusively Houghton Mifflin/Springer dominated market of educational materials, No Child Left Behind, and a collapse of higher education's appeal to the average person, my immediate reaction to most geology educational materials, whether has been delivered to me, or I have been tasked with delivering it, is that it is usually incompatible to the neeeds of the modern student, especially those who have little previous experience with the topic. The incompatibility continues into graduate school. As specialization closes off access to information, even people with advanced geology degrees cannot unpack the problems of similar disciplines.

Usually, geology education is composed of oversimplifications, hero narratives, the emphasis on grand theories and an image of absolute truth. The complexities, the compelling stories that turn the popular truisms upside down are usually not revealed until graduate level research. Is this really the reward for sticking it out in Geology? The decision to oversimplify information to the public and to undergraduate students presents a real disservice to the discipline, and erodes trust in geology as a science that can address uncertainties, even big ones like climate change. 

**My solution to this concrete barrier of access is to abandon the standard narrative of textbook science, and teach geology by incorporating history and humanism.**

**History/Philosophy of Science**

I often think of myself sitting in my first geology class at UCSD, observing students with pre-existing knowledge respond correctly to the professor's impulsive desire to ask if anyone can tell him how Yosemite was created. I wondered how someone could have an ability to narrate a sequence of geologic events on the spot. It seemed impossible to me. *So these are what geologists are like-- well...I'll still get the degree, but I guess it really isn't for me*, I thought. More than a decade later, it turns out I advanced in Geology further than those admirably confident students who had impressed the professors.

Instead of feeling optimistic about other students' ability to persist in geology, I am not reassured by my own success. I could have easily pursued another field of study if circumstances were different. One factor in my success was pursuing a double major in History.

I am grateful to my undegraduate studies in History-- I learned the complex nuances of events in the world and found great satisfaction in uncovering a more complex, but robust understanding of what had registered in my mind as a truism. I started writing papers about the connection between geologic events and specific periods in human history. Eventually, I became familiar with the history and philosophy of geology, and the very human debates and conflicts that emerged, from the 1400s to the 1980s. I came to realize that the overwhelm of graduate research had less to do with my inherent ability to "do science" or understand the complexities of disequilibrium fractionation in plume lavas, but that I was a newcomer in a scientific field that had fast-tracked its way to legitimacy as a full-fledged scientific field in the late 1960s-- very much with the help of war and military support, but had done little to establish a standard philosophy of practice.

Historically, the most significant contributions to knowledge about Geology has never been done by someone who majored in Geology. Though I make this comment in the spirit of jest, the realization that more outsiders have contributed to Geology than insiders would have been reassuring for someone like me, who did not feel like she belonged in Geology, from the first geology class, and even to the point where I was sitting in a *graduate-level Geology course*. There is ample opportunity to transform geology education to a truthful, human-oriented, and literally down-to-earth science. We just have to be wiling to distance ourselves from the inertia of pre-packaged textbook lessons.

**Misinformation and using the Internet**

I grew up reading print books, and started using computers towards the end of my elementary school years. As a first-generation student with little guidance, I was adept enough at using the Internet as a tool for information by the time I finished high school-- I would not have completed college applications without it. The Internet has revolutionized access to information, but a barrage of endless information that is presented to students without concern for their attention threshold and ability to practice deep focus encourages skimming and producing the right answer via the path of least resistance. It is not enough to claim that geology is a visual discipline, and refuse to guide students through a systematic workflow of observations. Acknowledging that the jargon, concepts, and framework of geology takes *time* to master, as one would take the time to master a language, is needed to maximize retention of important geologic concepts. Otherwise, the most compelling result on Google (or worse, the automated summary) is good enough for an answer. I incorporate as many opportunities for students to practice seeing new patterns (essentially priming) and I scaffold complex problems. This is always a challenge in the 10-week quarter, but borrowing the first 15 minutes of a 1.5 hr lab period towards this type of practice has rarely left students scrambling to finish their work.

While I have no issues with using Google for information, I strive to design "unGoogle-able" assignments, and my goal is to teach a class that only relies on assigned course materials or a few (not infinite) published resources. I also avoid framing citational practice as a lesson on plagiarism-- it is a practice of community. In the future, I aim to incorporate paper metadata, peer review, journal errata, and comments to emphasize the surprisingly slow place of research debates. Furthermore, AI technologies like GPT already produce writing that is indistinguishable from an average student's (and have even been accepted into peer reviewed journals). One of my future goals is to create summative assessments that do not rely on TurnItIn or similar automated integrity shortcuts. Our reliance on web resources, without requisite education about expertise, trust, funding sources leaves students unable to discern trustworthy information. Our education should be empowering students to notice, examine, and reflect on their exposure to misinformation.
