# Overview

**Core competencies**: Developing assignments, designing exam questions and proctoring, and guiding students through scientific writing and presentations. The majority of my teaching is in 10-week quarters in which the pace of information must be delivered in a logical sequence to promote understanding and retention.

**Ability to adapt**: Many geoscience courses are increasingly "turn key" and optimized for learning from specific textbooks. Even while teaching for the first time, I have been able to quickly modify and develop novel assignments with an emphasis on building skills related to the natural sciences. I do this while collecting student feedback throughout the course to assess effectiveness. This usually results in additional material being presented, in addition to the original curriculum. Courses in which I have taught multiple times show improved student ratings and evidence of engagement-- reflecting my ability to adapt during the course, and future opportunities to teach the same material.

**Designing for accessibility**: Radical improvements in accessible materials (specifically related to vision and physical accessibility on field trips) is often out of my control as a TA. However, for the majority of my teaching experience, I have still been able to provide materials in multiple formats, offer alternative modes of feedback, and develop alternative field trip assignments. I design coursework for accessibility whether my interactions with students are in-person, remote, asynchronous, and/or synchronous. 

**Learning in the field**: I have led field trips in 5 classes (2 overnight/multi-day) in Southern California, Eastern Oregon, and Coastal Oregon.

**Collaboration**: I have served as instructor of record in 2 classes. I have worked with 12 instructors in my capacity as a GTA and collaborate often to maximize student usability of course materials. I am adept at Blackboard and Canvas.
