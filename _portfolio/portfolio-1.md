# Summary of Teaching Experience

This is a summary of teaching experience with course names, titles, and basic duties. Overall, I have competency in developing assignments, designing exam questions and proctoring, and guiding students through scientific writing and presentations. The majority of my teaching is in 10-week quarters in which the pace of information must be delivered in a logical sequence to promote understanding and retention. Courses in which I have taught multiple times show improved student ratings and evidence of engagement-- reflecting my ability to adapt during the course, and future opportunities to teach the same material.

I have led field trips in 5 classes (2 overnight/multi-day) in Southern California, Eastern Oregon, and Coastal Oregon.

Bolded courses are taught as Instructor of Record.
