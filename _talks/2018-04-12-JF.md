# Trace element, Sr-Nd-Pb isotope geochemistry of Juan Fernandez lavas

I presented my findings about the Juan Fernandez islands during the session: "Geophysical and geochemical insights into volcanic hotspots and large igneous provinces". This was the morning of the very special, student-organized conference about volcanology research done by scholars at Oregon institutions. I convened the session and introduced 3 other amazing talks. Just for fun, you can read my introduction script below.

> Thanks everyone for attending the second session of student talks of the first Volcanology
Students of Oregon Conference! I will be introducing the second topic, “Geophysical and
geochemical insights into volcanic hotspots and large igneous provinces.” I was banking on Peter
to introduce the topic of Large igneous provinces in the previous session, and indeed, he did a
beautiful job, so there’s not much left for me to say, is there? The twin phenomena
of intraplate hotspots and large volcanic provinces do not discriminate among the oceanic and
continental lithosphere when they manifest on the Earth’s surface. Today’s range of talks will
reflect not only the variability of this volcanism, but the diversity of methods used to study them,
and the various competing hypotheses proposed to explain them. Intraplate volcanism reflects a
very small proportion of the annual volcanic production, with hotspots and large igneous
provinces accounting for less than 10% of the annual volcanic output. In addition to answering
the most basic question of why anomalous volcanism occurs, studying these phenomena
provides insights into many still unknown questions after the Plate Tectonics Revolution. Some
examples of these questions are: What initiates plate movement? How do you break up
supercontinents? What geologic events correspond to mass extinctions?

## AGU Presentation

I was invited to speak on the topic of the origin, evolution, and distribution of volatiles in planetary interiors for the Fall AGU meeting in 2021. [Fellow session presenters](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm21/meetingapp.cgi/Session/132412) shared work that tackled timescales of cycling, implications for large-scale planetary processes, and utilized a range of volatile species. I focused on the possible co-existence of primordial mantle source with recycled material by exploring variation recorded in Helium isotopes, major volatiles and trace elements. Not bad for a tiny volcano!

Text inset states: Lō‘ihi Seamount: 975 meters below sea level, 150-200,000 years old (with reference to Guillou et al., 1997). Compass direction states that this view is nearly facing towards the North, perhaps 10 degrees to the East. An irregular volcano structure stands out from the rest of the seafloor. The shallowest, slightly flat area is annotated in grey and labeled 'summit'. There is a short, red line emanating from the summit, labeled, 'North Rift'. An even longer blue line emanates to the south from the summit, labeled 'South Rift'. The caption on this screen says, This is Loihi Seamount. It is a young volcano with two rift zones, which developed early in its history. Presenter Thi Truong is visible in corner.">
