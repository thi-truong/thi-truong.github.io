# Trace element, Sr-Nd-Pb isotope geochemistry of Juan Fernandez lavas

Text: Juan Fernandez notable among other high-3He/4He OIBs for range in ratios. Despite this range, has relatively limited, nearly homogeneous range of Sr-Nd isotopic signature. Natland (2003) proposed shallow-level disequilibrium, complex history of magmatic differentiation with “xenocryst” olivines decoupled 3He/4He. Juan Fernandez is an important case study for Helium isotopic variations. Graphic: Histogram showing number of analyses for 3He/4He from 8-18 RA (bin size = 1). Color-coded for the two islands Alexander Selkirk (values mostly between 8-10 RA) and Robinson Crusoe (values mostly between 11-18 RA) Bottom shows Yellow banner text of phrase formatted like equation: Age-progressive volcanism (check-mark) + High 3He/4He (>9 RA) (check-mark) = Mantle plume (??)">
