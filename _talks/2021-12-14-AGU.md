## AGU Presentation

I was invited to speak on the topic of the origin, evolution, and distribution of volatiles in planetary interiors for the Fall AGU meeting in 2021. [Fellow session presenters](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm21/meetingapp.cgi/Session/132412) shared work that tackled timescales of cycling, implications for large-scale planetary processes, and utilized a range of volatile species. I focused on the possible co-existence of primordial mantle source with recycled material by exploring variation recorded in Helium isotopes, major volatiles and trace elements. Not bad for a tiny volcano!

Title: Situating Juan Fernandez in Global OIB Studies. Text: Juan Fernandez notable among other high-3He/4He OIBs for range in ratios. Despite this range, has relatively limited, nearly homogeneous range of Sr-Nd isotopic signature. Natland (2003) proposed shallow-level disequilibrium, complex history of magmatic differentiation with “xenocryst” olivines decoupled 3He/4He. Juan Fernandez is an important case study for Helium isotopic variations. Graphic: Histogram showing number of analyses for 3He/4He from 8-18 RA (bin size = 1). Color-coded for the two islands Alexander Selkirk (values mostly between 8-10 RA) and Robinson Crusoe (values mostly between 11-18 RA) Bottom shows Yellow banner text of phrase formatted like equation: Age-progressive volcanism (check-mark) + High 3He/4He (>9 RA) (check-mark) = Mantle plume (??)">

* Studies of Hawaiian volcanoes contribute valuable insights about Earth processes and mantle evolution, and are fundamental for understanding the construction of the largest volcanoes on terrestrial planets.
* The pre-shield stage exists in every Hawaiian volcano, but is usually blanketed by high volume tholeiitic lava flows which erupt during the main shield stage.
* Submarine Lō‘ihi Seamount represents the elusive pre-shield stage, and has transitioned to early shield-type tholeiitic eruptions.
* Previous studies suggest that Lō‘ihi basaltic glasses have trapped gases with a signature deriving from an ancient, primordial reservoir within the deep mantle.
* The persistence and distribution of this signature is unknown, and its rare signature is easily contaminated by Earth's atmosphere, as well as subducted materials that have been recycled into the mantle.
* We analyzed the chemical composition of deeply erupted glasses to understand the evolution and modification of rare gas signatures at young Lō‘ihi Seamount.
* Our results suggest that tholeiitic shield-type lavas continue to sample the primordial mantle reservoir. This signal does not appear to be diluted even though relative melt volume has increased.
