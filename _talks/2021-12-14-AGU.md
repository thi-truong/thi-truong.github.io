# Abstract

Much of our understanding of the earliest “pre-shield” stage of hotspot volcanism comes from Lō‘ihi Seamount lavas, which contain the highest <sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He ratios~35 R<sub>a</sub> (Rsub>a</sub> is the atmospheric ratio) from the Hawaiian-Emperor chain. High-<sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He originates from a primordial mantle reservoir with chemical attributes of an early Earth, but radiogenic isotope and trace element compositions of Hawaiian lavas indicate a source that incorporated recycled crustal materials. The quantity of recycled material may be constrained by using volatile (CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, <sup>3</sup>He) concentrations from volcanic materials. Glassy rinds of deeply erupted submarine basalts are likely to retain their volatile inventory, but are still prone to degassing and contamination.

Here, we report new coupled volatile and trace element analyses of 40 deeply erupted basaltic glasses from Lō‘ihi Seamount (mostly South Rift, 1.3-5.1 km water depth). We used in vacuo crushing to extract vesicle He and CO<sub>2</sub>, _in vacuo_ melting to extract dissolved He, FTIR to measure dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O, and LA-ICP-MS to measure trace elements.

Lō‘ihi tholeiites have higher <sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He than transitional and alkali basalts. Rare earth element patterns suggest all lavas (North and South Rift) derive from a similar mantle source that experienced variable extents of depletion by prior melt extraction. Modeling indicates the lavas were derived by 3-15% partial melting initiated at various depths within garnet and spinel lherzolite stability fields. Notably, a North Rift tholeiite with <sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He=30.7 R<sub>a</sub> derives from higher amounts of melting from a more depleted mantle than South Rift tholeiites. This contrasts with earlier ideas of increased asthenosphere input and lowering of <sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He as shield-building proceeds.

Total CO<sub>2</sub>/<sup>3</sup>He overlaps with mantle values, ranging upward from 1x10<sup>9</sup>. Some elevated ratios (≥5x10<sup>9</sup>) may suggest the presence of recycled C within the mantle plume. CO<sub>2</sub>/Ba<3 indicates lavas lost >95% of their CO<sub>2</sub> by degassing, but H<sub>2</sub>O/K<sub>2</sub>O>1 shows they have not experienced extensive dehydration. Average H<sub>2</sub>O/Ce~220 overlaps with typical mantle; a few samples with elevated values (~400) may indicate the presence of hydrous material within the plume. Our results help to better understand the nature and modification of primordial noble gas signatures from heterogeneous mantle sources.

# Plain Language Summary:

Studies of Hawaiian volcanoes contribute valuable insights about Earth processes and mantle evolution, and are fundamental for understanding the construction of the largest volcanoes on terrestrial planets. The pre-shield stage exists in every Hawaiian volcano, but is usually blanketed by high volume tholeiitic lava flows which erupt during the main shield stage. Submarine Lō‘ihi Seamount represents the elusive pre-shield stage, and has transitioned to early shield-type tholeiitic eruptions. Previous studies suggest that Lō‘ihi basaltic glasses have trapped gases with a signature deriving from an ancient, primordial reservoir within the deep mantle. The persistence and distribution of this signature is unknown, and its rare signature is easily contaminated by Earth's atmosphere, as well as subducted materials that have been recycled into the mantle. We analyzed the chemical composition of deeply erupted glasses to understand the evolution and modification of rare gas signatures at young Lō‘ihi Seamount. Our results suggest that tholeiitic shield-type lavas continue to sample the primordial mantle reservoir. This signal does not appear to be diluted even though relative melt volume has increased.
