Text inset states: Lō‘ihi Seamount: 975 meters below sea level, 150-200,000 years old (with reference to Guillou et al., 1997). Compass direction states that this view is nearly facing towards the North, perhaps 10 degrees to the East. An irregular volcano structure stands out from the rest of the seafloor. The shallowest, slightly flat area is annotated in grey and labeled 'summit'. There is a short, red line emanating from the summit, labeled, 'North Rift'. An even longer blue line emanates to the south from the summit, labeled 'South Rift'. The caption on this screen says, This is Loihi Seamount. It is a young volcano with two rift zones, which developed early in its history. Presenter Thi Truong is visible in corner.">

## Plain Language Summary

* Studies of Hawaiian volcanoes contribute valuable insights about Earth processes and mantle evolution, and are fundamental for understanding the construction of the largest volcanoes on terrestrial planets.
* The pre-shield stage exists in every Hawaiian volcano, but is usually blanketed by high volume tholeiitic lava flows which erupt during the main shield stage.
* Submarine Lō‘ihi Seamount represents the elusive pre-shield stage, and has transitioned to early shield-type tholeiitic eruptions.
* Previous studies suggest that Lō‘ihi basaltic glasses have trapped gases with a signature deriving from an ancient, primordial reservoir within the deep mantle.
* The persistence and distribution of this signature is unknown, and its rare signature is easily contaminated by Earth's atmosphere, as well as subducted materials that have been recycled into the mantle.
* We analyzed the chemical composition of deeply erupted glasses to understand the evolution and modification of rare gas signatures at young Lō‘ihi Seamount.
* Our results suggest that tholeiitic shield-type lavas continue to sample the primordial mantle reservoir. This signal does not appear to be diluted even though relative melt volume has increased.
