# Description
This workshop is an introductory primer on one aspect of inclusive design, tailored for CLIMATE Justice Initiative fellows at UC Irvine. Participants share a foundation in research justice principles and versatile communication skills from previous coursework and ongoing workshops. This workshop focuses on non-text media (static images), which is relevant for developing an online presence, disseminate scholarly research products, and co-producing impactful deliverables with community organizations as a result of the fellowship.

# Purpose
The workshop aims to equip participants to address the gaps in alt-text availability on the web. By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to identify the presence of alt-text on various platforms, write appropriate alt-text for photographs and simple data visualizations, and provide constructive feedback about peers' alt-text for shared content. This workshop intervenes on the persistent lack of alternative text availability, which contributes to exclusion of Blind/low vision users on the Internet. 

# Activities:
The strategies and recommendations incorporated in the workshop derive predominantly from the work of Blind/low scholars, web users, programmers, and web accessibility organizations. 
* A conceptual exploration of the social model of disability, misconceptions about blindness and technology, and a demonstration of screen reader software on various geoscience websites.
* Structured practice to write alt-text for 6 example images, including a variety of data visualizations. The novel training images provide participants with a hands-on experience in remediating their personal content archives. In addition, the majority of the training images have available alt-text, which allows participants to compare their work.
* Breakout group activities where they collaborate on crafting alt-text for each other's work. Participants are encouraged to articulate their choice to include or exclude information when writing alt-text.
* A concluding discussion highlights recent alt-text compliance trends on Twitter, cautioning against added web/social media responsibilities that may exacerbate labor distribution inequities among junior scholars or staff members.

# Impact

## Feedback
Participant feedback described the workshop as an engaging introduction to accessibility through alternative text practices, sparking newfound awareness and knowledge among participants through interactive group activities and hands-on exercises.

To enhance the workshop experience, participants suggested incorporating additional examples of how government/scientific agencies describe complex images, allocating more time for exercises, changing the format to in-person to increase engagement, and hosting more workshops in the future.
