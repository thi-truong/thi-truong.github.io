# Workshop

**Description:**
* The workshop was an introductory primer on inclusive design and image accessibility designed for CLIMATE Justice Initiative fellows at UC Irvine. Participants have a growing understanding of research justice principles from previous/ongoing workshops and related curricula.
* The workshop focused on non-text media (images), which is relevant for developing an online presence, disseminating scholarly research products, and co-producing impactful deliverables with community organizations as a result of the fellowship.
* This work intervenes on the persistent lack of alternative text online by incorporating strategies and recommendations from the Blind/low vision community, to remediate inaccessible non-text media online.

**Format:**
* Virtual Zoom Meeting
* Tools: Google Slides, Zoom polls, NonVisual Desktop Access (NVDA), Zoom chat, Zoom breakout rooms.

**Participant Testimonials:** 

> *"I like how Thi got the class engaged. It was a fun and learning journey for me"*

> *"Dr. Thi did a wonderful job explaining the importance of different inclusive practices and also lead an engaging activity via zoom. It was the first time I had been part of a workshop that focused on inclusive design."*

# Activities

## Introduction and Concepts
* Administered anonymous poll to establish baseline experience with alt-text and screen readers. 
* Conceptual exploration of the social model of disability, misconceptions about blind users and technology
* Demonstration of screen reader software on various geoscience websites

Poll responses to the question, **How familiar are you with "alternative text"?** show that one quarter of respondents have never heard of the term, and half knew of alternative text and have used it to some extent:

Results show 24% never heard of it, 15% heard of it but don't remember, 46% know of it and used a few times, 15% know of it and use it often"></center>

Responses to the question, **Have you ever used screen reader software before?** show that half do not have previous experience with screen reader software. There were no responses indicating greater than a moderate amount of experience with screen readers:

## Large group practice
* Participants learned how to check for alt-text on existing images and individually practiced writing 1-3 sentence alt-text desriptions for 6 example images, including a variety of data visualizations. 
* The majority of the training images for exercises have available alt-text, which allows participants to compare their work. In addition, they could access chat to see other responses. 

## Breakout room practice
* Breakout group activities where they collaborate on crafting alt-text for each other's work, and format the images on a previous collaborative Google Slide deck of project overviews. Groups were instructed to write alt-text for *other* groups' work, which was feasible in the time allotted, as they all have shared previous context about their community-based research projects in class discussions, and participants chose the slides to work on.
* During large group review and debrief, I facilitated a discussion with prepared prompts about the process. I provided comments and suggestions to the alt-text and invited original group to comment on accuracy, context or details. 

## Closing

A concluding discussion includes results of a recent analysis of alt-text compliance trends on Twitter for different university organizations and departments (UCI, UCSD, URI). Social media teamwork reveals the need for extra documentation steps due to lack of alt-text in image metadata, and participants were recommended to act with caution when adding web/social media responsibilities that may exacerbate labor distribution inequities among junior scholars or staff members.

# Impact

## Feedback
Participant feedback described the workshop as an engaging introduction to accessibility through alternative text practices, sparking newfound awareness and knowledge among participants through interactive group activities and hands-on exercises.

To enhance the workshop experience, participants suggested incorporating additional examples of how government/scientific agencies describe complex images, allocating more time for exercises, changing the format to in-person to increase engagement, and hosting more workshops in the future.
