## Overview
* The workshop was a 110 minute introduction to inclusive design and image accessibility designed for CLIMATE Justice Initiative fellows at UC Irvine.
  - The group of fellows consists of postbaccalaureate and doctoral students trained in a range of science and social science fields. Fellows have learned about principles of research justice and communication skills for environmental scholars.
  - No preparation or previous experience with web design or accessibility was required. 
* The workshop format was virtual and held as a Zoom Meeting.
  - Participants interacted with Google Slides, Zoom polls, Zoom chat, and Zoom breakout rooms.
* My focus on alternative text for static images intervenes on the problem of high volumes of inaccessible media published by universities and research organizations online.
  - I incorporated strategies, recommendations, and resources largely from Blind/low vision individuals and communities online.

## Testimonials
Participant feedback generally described the workshop as an engaging introduction to accessibility through alternative text practices.

> *"I like how Thi got the class engaged. It was a fun and learning journey for me"*

The workshop also sparked newfound awareness and knowledge about the inclusive design through interactive group activities and hands-on exercises.

> *"Dr. Thi did a wonderful job explaining the importance of different inclusive practices and also lead an engaging activity via zoom. It was the first time I had been part of a workshop that focused on inclusive design."*

 ## Participants Background

The workshop began with a poll to establish baseline experience with alt-text and screen readers. One quarter of respondents have never heard of the term "alternative text". 

<img src="/images/inclusive_design_alt_text_piechart.png"  width="85%" height="85%" alt = "Pie chart showing responses for How familiar are you with alternative text? Results show 24% never heard of it, 15% heard of it but don't remember, 46% know of it and used a few times, 15% know of it and use it often">

When asked about screen reader software usage, half of respondents did not have any previous experience with screen reader software. There were no responses indicating greater than a moderate amount of experience.

## Detailed Workshop Structure

<a id="item-four"></a>
### Introduction and software demo

* Conceptual exploration of the social model of disability, misconceptions about blind users and technology, definitions of assistive technology, alternative text, and captions 
* Demonstrated NonVisual Desktop Access (NVDA) screen reader software on images from geoscience organization websites

<a id="item-five"></a>
### Application Part 1: Individual practice

* Participants learned how to check for alt-text on existing images and learned about the difference between alternative text and captions
* Participants individually practiced writing 1-3 sentence alt-text descriptions for 6 example images, which include photos, simple graphics, and data visualizations
* Practice images for exercises had suitable, existing alt-text for the images. Providing links to these source encourages participants to access alt-text information independently to compare their work.

<a id="item-six"></a>
### Application Part 2: Small group breakout task

* Participants collaborate to write alt-text for each other's work from a previous collaborative Google Slide deck of community-based project overviews.
* Held a large group debrief where each breakout group explained their alt-text choices and process, followed by comments from original group members about the accuracy, context, and other information.
<!--- * Discussion about resources needed to write complete alt-text for completely unfamiliar images. --->

### Closing Discussion

Analysis of trends on Twitter for posts with photos by 4 university departments (2 - UCI, 1 - UCSD, 1 - URI) over a 2-week period from 1/24/24 to 2/7/24. These departments were chosen because of their activity-- all have posted images continuously since January 2024. The analysis revealed many opportunities:

* None of these departments use alt-text to 100% compliance.
* UCI department of Social Ecology is particularly notable for publishing 68 posts total at a rate of 5 photos/day, with less than 10% containing alt-text. 
* The lack of any alt-text from UCI Earth System Science (ESS) also reveals a clear need to increase alt-text usage and follow the example of other geoscience departments, URI Graduate School of Oceanography and Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

UCI Social Ecology posts the most images without alt-text, whereas Scripps Ocean posts the most images with alt-text.">

A closing discussion further reveals opportunities, challenges, and suggestions for further reflection about maintaining alternative text standards among diverse teams and web platforms.
