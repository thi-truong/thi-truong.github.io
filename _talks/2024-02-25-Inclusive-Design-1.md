# Workshop

## Overview
* The workshop was a 110 minute introduction to inclusive design and image accessibility, and designed for CLIMATE Justice Initiative fellows at UC Irvine. The group of fellows consists of postbaccalaureate and doctoral students trained in a range of science and social science fields.
  - No preparation or previous experience with web design or accessibility was required. However, fellows have learned about principles of research justice and communication skills for environmental scholars.
* The workshop format was virtual and held as a Zoom Meeting.
  - Participants interacted with Google Slides, Zoom polls, Zoom chat, and Zoom breakout rooms.
* My focus on alternative text for static images intervenes on the problem of high volumes of inaccessible media published by universities and research organizations online. I incorporate strategies, recommendations, and resources largely from  Blind/low vision individuals and communities online.

## Feedback
Participant feedback described the workshop as an engaging introduction to accessibility through alternative text practices.

> *"I like how Thi got the class engaged. It was a fun and learning journey for me"*

The workshop also sparked newfound awareness and knowledge about the inclusive design through interactive group activities and hands-on exercises.

> *"Dr. Thi did a wonderful job explaining the importance of different inclusive practices and also lead an engaging activity via zoom. It was the first time I had been part of a workshop that focused on inclusive design."*

# Workshop Structure
  
## Introduction

The workshop began with a poll to establish baseline experience with alt-text and screen readers. One quarter of respondents have never heard of the term "alternative text", while and half were familiar with the term, have used alternative text to some extent. Half of respondents did not have previous experience with screen reader software, and there were no responses indicating greater than a moderate amount of experience with screen readers.

Results show 24% never heard of it, 15% heard of it but don't remember, 46% know of it and used a few times, 15% know of it and use it often"> <img src="/images/inclusive_design_screenreader_annotate.png"  width="42%" height="42%" alt = "Pie chart showing responses for Have you ever used screen reader software before?

### Concepts and Demo

* Conceptual exploration of the social model of disability, misconceptions about blind users and technology, definitions of assistive technology, alternative text, and captions 
* Demonstrated NonVisual Desktop Access (NVDA) screen reader software on images from geoscience organization websites



## Application

### Individual practice: photos and data visualizations

* Participants learned how to check for alt-text on existing images and individually practiced writing 1-3 sentence alt-text desriptions for 6 example images, including a variety of data visualizations. 
* Training images for exercises were often selected because they had suitable, pre-existing alt-text published by somoene else. Providing links to these source encourages participants to access alt-text information independently to compare their work.

### Small group practice: images from community research overview slides

* Participants collaborate to write alt-text for each other's work, and format the images on a previous collaborative Google Slide deck of project overviews.
* Large group debrief and discussion about resources needed to write complete alt-text for unfamiliar images. Each breakout group explained their alt-text choices and process, followed by comments from original group members about the accuracy, context, and other information. 

## Closing Discussion

Analysis of trends on Twitter for posts with photos by different university departments over a 2-week period from 1/24/24 to 2/7/24 does not show any department with 100% alt-text use. However, the trend reveals a clear opportunity for UCI departments to increase alt-text usage, to approach the example of URI Graduate School of Oceanography or UC San Diego/Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

UCI Social Ecology posts the most images without alt-text, whereas Scripps Ocean posts the most images with alt-text.">

A closing discussion further reveals opportunities, challenges, and suggestions for further reflection about maintaining alternative text standards among diverse teams and web platforms.
